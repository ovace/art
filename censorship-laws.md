# Censorship laws

What is the definition of child porn?

-   Are drawings child porn? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolicon> No child is abused for that. And what is a child in a drawing?

-   What about textual description?

What does owning mean? What about:

- 4chan-like image boards with randomly posted content?
- child pornography mixed in with adult pornography may be difficult to spot
- is having a link to child pornography illegal? What about a link to a link? And a link to that?
- and the blockchain http://www.dailydot.com/business/bitcoin-child-porn-transaction-code/

And what if women like this want to post their porn online? Is it even legal to have sex with them? <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2946068/The-teenager-never-grow-19-year-old-looks-like-young-child-rare-condition-affecting-growth-hormones.html>

## Weapons

TODO: is it legal to describe how to make weapons? In particular, 3D printer designs.

## Defamation

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation>

Interesting that there are laws for that. Who would believe someone who defames others?
