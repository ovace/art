    Anarchists, crypto version.

-   Splat is a name for asterisk.

    Probably etymology: when a bug hits the car's window, it sounds like "splat",
    and the bug then looks like an asterisk.

-   Some dev put on his blog's tag line:

    > "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept. -- RFC-XXX"

    When I noticed that he was paraphrasing Confucius, it blew my mind:

    > "A Gentleman Is Strict with Himself and Tolerant of Others."

    RFCs contain ancient Chinese wisdom.

-   Facebook `index.php` and `search.php` code leaked by hacker who stole it: <http://techcrunch.com/2007/08/11/facebook-source-code-leaked/>

        Fixed bug that removed the `/usr` directory on install on a large project...

        GitHub added a special banner on the last commit of an influential Ruby programmer before he died on he same day of a heart attack.

-   <http://mrdoob.com/#/147/google_space> super cool 2D physical simulation

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius> The creator of MySQL loves naming projects after his children! Another Finnish powerhouse.

-   "Atwood's Law" (SO): any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript.

-   <http://darkpatterns.org/>

    Malicious web design patterns made to make people buy stuff they don't want.

-   Git 2.1 new dates formats: `--date="midnight the 12th of october, anno domini 1979"` or `--date=teatime`.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity>

-   <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>

    The program and language used to generate the `info` manuals, official GNU doc tool.

    Initially coded by Stallman. Today, feels like it is only relevant as part of the GNU cult / dream, while `man` has dominated.

    It compiles natively to both HTML and PDF, but not `man`. In general, information on `info` manuals are great and filled with examples, unlike `man` manuals which are much more formal.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext>

    Cryptography term for the unencrypted message being sent.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash>

    Obscure typographical characters: the en dash and the em dash.

    Both have HTML entities: `&ndash` and `&mdash`.

    Hodor being my favorite.

-   Tweets in Chinese can contain way more information since they are limited to 140 *Chinese* characters,
    and most Chinese words are 1 or 2 characters long!

-   LLVM compiles C, C++, etc. to a standard object code, somewhat like Java does,
    but the object code is meant to go through compilation after optimization.

-   Technical debt: when you implement fast but something without taking precautions like testing.

    This generates a cost for the future,
    which later you will have to pay in the form of bugs.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext>

    Cryptography term for the unencrypted message being sent.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication>

    Uses multiple types of authentication amongst:

    - knowledge factors: something the user knows. Password.
    - possession factors: something the user has. Key, credit card, private RSA pair.
    - inheritance factors: something only the user can have. Biometrics and behavior metrics like signature.

    In software computing systems, the most common type if 2 factor authentication (2FA)
    with knowledge and possession factors of password and private key pair.

    Early Google Maps predecessor.

-   Very interesting IBM electro-mechanical typing machine mechanism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter>

    Introduced in the 60's dominated the American market.

    Advantage: the entire font is contained in a single mechanical piece. Easy to change, harder to break.

    Found it on the film <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_%28film%29>

## Design

I'm not a design person, but sometimes I'm surprised.

-   <https://design.ubuntu.com/brand> Ubuntu brand guidelines.

-   <http://railscasts.com/episodes/302-in-place-editing?view=asciicast>

    Used extensively on modern websites like GitHub and Stack Overflow.

    Greatly improves the user experience for almost all fields because it becomes
    much faster to edit: no need to reload the page every time.

    Cases where it cannot be used:

    -   huge textareas, specially ones where you would be tempted to enable ACE for, e.g. GitHub blob edit.

    -   objects that are version controlled and where you want to allow editing
        multiple fields on a single edit, operation e.g. Stack Overflow questions
        which have title, body and tags.
