    The program and language used to generate the `info` manuals, official GNU doc tool.

    Initially coded by Stallman. Today, feels like it is only relevant as part of the GNU cult / dream, while `man` has dominated.

    It compiles natively to both HTML and PDF, but not `man`. In general, information on `info` manuals are great and filled with examples, unlike `man` manuals which are much more formal.

-   Tweets in Chinese can contain way more information since they are limited to 140 *Chinese* characters,
    and most Chinese words are 1 or 2 characters long!

-   LLVM compiles C, C++, etc. to a standard object code, somewhat like Java does,
    but the object code is meant to go through compilation after optimization.

-   Technical debt: when you implement fast but something without taking precautions like testing.

    This generates a cost for the future,
    which later you will have to pay in the form of bugs.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication>

    Uses multiple types of authentication amongst:

    - knowledge factors: something the user knows. Password.
    - possession factors: something the user has. Key, credit card, private RSA pair.
    - inheritance factors: something only the user can have. Biometrics and behavior metrics like signature.

    In software computing systems, the most common type if 2 factor authentication (2FA)
    with knowledge and possession factors of password and private key pair.

    Advantage: the entire font is contained in a single mechanical piece. Easy to change, harder to break.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_%28computer_security%29>

    Exploit: the actual code that makes use of the vulnerability.

    It is possible that a vulnerability exists, but no on has exploited it in practice and it is not clear if it is possible to do so or not.

    Still, it is known similar situations have been exploited, and that exploits that were believed not to be possible sometimes become so.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack>

    Attack that exploits an yet unknown vulnerability to the public,
    e.g. Heartbleed.

    There are companies and consultants who specialize in finding such bugs
    to sell them to government spies, like ReVuln <http://revuln.com/>

    Cool disclaimers on who they claim to sell for:
