    Many species have more than 2 pairs of each chromosome:

    - plants: several, including crops. Durum wheat is the only tetraploid wheat variant.
    - animals: there are 12 ploid lizards, but no functional mammals with more than 2. Some experiments have made some, but they don't live to birth / long.

        Mamals have monoploid reproductive cells.

    - procariotes: all monoploid.
