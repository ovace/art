    Similar pseudo secrete organizations with around 1M members,
    some religious like rituals with or without beliefs,
    and with a stated purpose of helping their communities.

    In practice, it is likely that those organizations strongly endorse acceptance
    of the most rich or powerful members of society,
    and that one major reason why people participate in them is to help themselves.

    In short: like an organized religious cults, but with less emphasis on superstitious beliefs,
    and more emphasis on elitism and secrecy.

-   Chinese defectors:

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yonglin>. Espionage accusations.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Wenhao> 1989, pilot in the plane to Taiwan.
        A money prize was paid at the time for defectors. Airplanes also had an anti-defection system,
        but it did not work very well that time.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xuecheng> 1983, pilot in plane to Taiwan.
        Received the standard 3000 taels gold prize by the Taiwan government given to defectors.

        Interesting to see the defection method, in particular how he waited for a chance
        to leave in an exercice where there were no wingmen, and when he had extra fuel.

        Taiwan and China used different radio requencies, so he had to communicate to the
        Taiwanese pilots who came to check him that he was a peaceful defector and that he had low fuel 
        only with airplane and hand gestures.

        Also interesting to see how he conserved fuel by firing all of his ammunition.

    It's "fun" to watch how people escape a dictatorship to tell the truth / get money.

    China's reply strategy is to discredit the person as being at a lower Government level than actual,
    and charges of corruption.

    There are many cold war / dictatorship pilot defection precedents:

    Color blindness test, made popular on the web as an amusement.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness>

    The informal term "Daltonism" for color blindness comes from the same Dalton
    who researched into atoms, who had the condition and studied it.

    The most common type of color blindness is Deuteranomaly, present in 5% of European males.
    It affects red-green discrimination, but does not prevent it entirely.

    There are rarer conditions in which red receptors are completely missing, in which red-green
    discrimination is impossible.

    thus the relation to flying (power by leaves) and the Tanooki turning into stone.

-   John le Carr√© on spy craft and his novels: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89FHIGL3N54>

    Intelligence differs from the police: you don't arrest people.
    You identify and watch them to get further information.

    Intelligence trade happened between countries. Size did not matter:
    only the quality of your information.

    While working for the intelligence, he already had to make up little stories (legends)
    for agents, much like while he was a writer.

    During the cold war, he says there were so many agents, that they would overstep themselves,
    and unknowingly corroborate information from other agents that came from a single source.

    The main problem of modern intelligence is evaluating the excess of information
    generated from technological sources. He suggests more importance should be
    given to the human sources themselves.
