# War

War, espionage, crime, violence, terrorism, revolution, police. In short: violent, fun stuff, which I wish did not happen.

    As shown in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_%28film%29>, some people managed to escape. One of them came back with a kitchen knife and managed to take down one terrorist, but then got shot and died.

### Aum Shinrikyo

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack> by .

It is incredible how a religious group could lead people to do those things. And that was not the only case where they've murdered.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=81uvbbsJC7M#t=114> Theorizes that great growth came from recruiting in top universities, where students where disillusioned by meaningless grading systems.

The "master" also claims on a television interview that those students wanted spirituality because they were materially wealthy and needed something else. I think this claim is plausible.

Also Japans' new religions benefited a lot from the end of the War, where at once people saw themselves free to choose.

Those also theorize that he became bitter with society after he lost the elections.

Next, he also made links with the Russian, which were also a falling empire that needed stability, and gained followers from the military which actually stole military secrets.

Part of the chemical experiences where carried in Tokyo itself, and residents even protested against them, but nothing was done: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81uvbbsJC7M>

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7uz8EYMYo> conjectures that he became such a successful leader due to him being blind from one eye and half blind on the other. As such, he went to a school for the blind, where he was at a very advantageous position to manipulate others.

It is also interesting to see excerpts from his propaganda animes.

The "master" on a television show: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=vQ7uz8EYMYo#t=398>

A parent who appears on street on television saying how the master stole his children away, and his wife urging him to stay away from the camera from fear of backslash: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=81uvbbsJC7M#t=744>

This hows how the weapon was prepared and deployed on subway: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=81uvbbsJC7M> Two bags are put inside a newspaper, then they use an umbrella to cut through both and mix the liquids.

### Jim Jones

Jonestown mass suicide. It is interesting to see that the act was triggered by increased repression from society towards the cult, much like Aum's.

Another common characteristic is the almost enslavement of followers, denying them all leisure, as a way to make them feel their lives meaningful.

Another common characteristic is fleeing the country of origin when repression starts to increase.

Another common point are end of the world predictions.

### Paul Schafer

-   receivers are the only illegal part: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-m0RRbfvh4>

    In the US law, only the finished receiver is a firearm: even an 80% finished one is not, nor are any of the other parts.

    There are also gun producers who claim to do it for an anarchism philosophy in which an armed society is fairer because the government cannot oppress it.

    Yes, you can then 3D print the receiver... <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DconsfGsXyA>

    High capacity magazines were banned in 1994, but those are really easy to print: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-capacity_magazine_ban>

### Leaks

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden>. NSA methods.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning>

    Responsible for the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak>

    Leaked to journals in 2010 to edit the names of people involved to protect them.

    A journalist by mistake published a sort of password on a book in 2011 allowing open access to the unedited cables.

    She is a had earlier performed sexual change to become a man.

    WikiLeaks got involved, and lead to the banking barrier imposed on it.

    Documents include:

    - 500 diplomatic cables
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granai_airstrike>
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike>

    A key testimony against her was <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo>, an ex-hacker which she knew online and to whom she confided what she had done.

    She was convicted to 35 years, parole on the 8th.

    It is likely that she was also responsible for the Afghan and Iraq War documents leak, although she was not officially charged for those:

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_War_documents_leak>

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak>. Documents the large number of civilian deaths that occurred.

-   John le CarrÃ© on spy craft and his novels: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89FHIGL3N54>

    Intelligence differs from the police: you don't arrest people. You identify and watch them to get further information.

    Intelligence trade happened between countries. Size did not matter: only the quality of your information.

    While working for the intelligence, he already had to make up little stories (legends) for agents, much like while he was a writer.

    During the cold war, he says there were so many agents, that they would overstep themselves, and unknowingly corroborate information from other agents that came from a single source.

    The main problem of modern intelligence is evaluating the excess of information generated from technological sources. He suggests more importance should be given to the human sources themselves.

    Fun to see how countries aligned, in particular how poorer countries who have been historically exploited by the rich like South America and African countries helped Argentina.

    Notable action in war... by animals!

    Given to pigeons, dogs and horses up to today.

## China

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq8zFLIftGk>. Tank man. Symbol of anti-dictatorship.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-10_Office>

    It's at the same time funny and tragic how we even know the names of offices which operate "semi-illegally", and very likely are responsible for human rights violations.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_intelligence_operations_in_the_United_States#Spy_cases>

-   Chinese defectors:

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yonglin>. Espionage accusations.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Wenhao> 1989, pilot in the plane to Taiwan. A money prize was paid at the time for defectors. Airplanes also had an anti-defection system, but it did not work very well that time.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xuecheng> 1983, pilot in plane to Taiwan. Received the standard 3000 taels gold prize by the Taiwan government given to defectors.

        Interesting to see the defection method, in particular how he waited for a chance to leave in an exercice where there were no wingmen, and when he had extra fuel.

        Taiwan and China used different radio requencies, so he had to communicate to the Taiwanese pilots who came to check him that he was a peaceful defector and that he had low fuel only with airplane and hand gestures.

        Also interesting to see how he conserved fuel by firing all of his ammunition.

    It's "fun" to watch how people escape a dictatorship to tell the truth / get money.

    China's reply strategy is to discredit the person as being at a lower Government level than actual, and charges of corruption.

    There are many cold war / dictatorship pilot defection precedents: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_MiG_behind_the_Iron_Curtain>
