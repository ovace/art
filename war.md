-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-official_cover> NOC

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes>. Major espionage alliance between USA, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks>. USA imposed an illegal banking barrier on it.

-   Classification levels used by the NSA: <https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/10/core-secrets/> Core secrets being the top level.

## Leaks

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden>. NSA methods.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning>

    Responsible for the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak>

    Leaked to journals in 2010 to edit the names of people involved to protect them.

    A journalist by mistake published a sort of password on a book in 2011 allowing open access to the unedited cables.

    She is a had earlier performed sexual change to become a man.

    WikiLeaks got involved, and lead to the banking barrier imposed on it.

    Documents include:

    - 500 diplomatic cables
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granai_airstrike>
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike>

    A key testimony against her was <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo>, an ex-hacker which she knew online and to whom she confided what she had done.

    She was convicted to 35 years, parole on the 8th.

    It is likely that she was also responsible for the Afghan and Iraq War documents leak, although she was not officially charged for those:

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_War_documents_leak>

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak>. Documents the large number of civilian deaths that occurred.

# Cold war

-   John le Carré on spy craft and his novels: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89FHIGL3N54>

    Intelligence differs from the police: you don't arrest people. You identify and watch them to get further information.

    Intelligence trade happened between countries. Size did not matter: only the quality of your information.

    While working for the intelligence, he already had to make up little stories (legends) for agents, much like while he was a writer.

    During the cold war, he says there were so many agents, that they would overstep themselves, and unknowingly corroborate information from other agents that came from a single source.

    The main problem of modern intelligence is evaluating the excess of information generated from technological sources. He suggests more importance should be given to the human sources themselves.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War>

    Fun to see how countries aligned, in particular how poorer countries who have been historically exploited by the rich like South America and African countries helped Argentina.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickin_Medal>

    Notable action in war... by animals!

    Given to pigeons, dogs and horses up to today.

    Started in WW2, with at least on recipient in 2014 for Afghanistan.

# WW2

-   Rediscovered WW2 propaganda turned pop:

    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On>
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Do_It!>

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising>

    Largest Jewish uprising in WW2. Depicted in the The Pianist 2002 film.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortitude> WW2 military deception.

# China

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq8zFLIftGk>. Tank man. Symbol of anti-dictatorship.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-10_Office>

    It's at the same time funny and tragic how we even know the names of offices which operate "semi-illegally", and very likely are responsible for human rights violations.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_intelligence_operations_in_the_United_States#Spy_cases>

-   Chinese defectors:

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yonglin>. Espionage accusations.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Wenhao> 1989, pilot in the plane to Taiwan. A money prize was paid at the time for defectors. Airplanes also had an anti-defection system, but it did not work very well that time.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xuecheng> 1983, pilot in plane to Taiwan. Received the standard 3000 taels gold prize by the Taiwan government given to defectors.

        Interesting to see the defection method, in particular how he waited for a chance to leave in an exercice where there were no wingmen, and when he had extra fuel.

        Taiwan and China used different radio requencies, so he had to communicate to the Taiwanese pilots who came to check him that he was a peaceful defector and that he had low fuel only with airplane and hand gestures.

        Also interesting to see how he conserved fuel by firing all of his ammunition.

    It's "fun" to watch how people escape a dictatorship to tell the truth / get money.

    China's reply strategy is to discredit the person as being at a lower Government level than actual, and charges of corruption.

    There are many cold war / dictatorship pilot defection precedents: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_MiG_behind_the_Iron_Curtain>
