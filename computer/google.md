# Google

-   One of the great innovations was to give results directly to users, instead of trying to keep them on a website for as long as possible.

-   First investment: they were sitting on the front of a professor's house on a Sunday morning, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim Sun co-founder came along, tried it for 10 minutes, and wrote an 100k check.

    They didn't have a company yet, and couldn't cash the check. There is a Silicon Valley allusion to that.

    Bezos from Amazon also put early 250k.

    Then came Sequoia and KP well known venture firms. They wanted an exclusive deal, but Googlers said no: joint only, to keep one VC from controlling all.

    They also kept adds small, and separated them from search results, unlike other competitors at the time.

    The money came with AdWords because people would search, and the adds would target well whatever they searched. So it is much easier for companies to get adds, than targeting for example a individual websites.

    From the beginning they put huge emphasis on great employee conditions.

    It seems that the Usenet was one of the major public discussion places. In particular for the development of programming languages.
