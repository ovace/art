-   `man telnet` on Ubuntu:

        BUGS
            The source code is not comprehensible.

-   `man sem_init`:

    > Bizarrely, POSIX.1-2001 does not specify the value that should be returned by a successful call to sem_init().  POSIX.1-2008 rectifies this, specifying the zero return on success.

## Parody laws

## Parody principles

-   [Godwin's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law)

    > As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.

    Basically a manifestation of <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum> on the net.

-   ["Atwood's Law"](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/):

    > Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

-   [Greenspun's tenth rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule)

    > Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc,
    > informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

    The corollary is cool:

    > including Common Lisp

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law>. Computers get faster, software gets slower, so there is not net improvement.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule>

## Cheap

    -   Who Represents:                  `whorepresents`

    -   Experts Exchange:                `expertsexchange`

    -   Pen Island:                      `penisland`

    -   Therapist Finder:                `therapistfinder`

    -   Italian Power Generator Company: `powergenitalia`

    -   Mole Station Native Nursery:     `molestationnursery`

## Man pages

In Vim:

    :help 42

Exuberant tags `man ctags`:

    BUGS

        Ctags has more options than ls(1).

### Comments

-   https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/binutils-2_25_1/gas/doc/as.texinfo#L5553

    GNn Gas doc

        @c no one seems to know what this is for or whether this description is
        @c what it really ought to do

-   `man patch` 2.7.1:

       -R  or  --reverse
          Assume  that  this  patch  was  created with the old and new files swapped.  (Yes, I'm afraid that does happen occasionally, human nature being what it is).

### Kernel

-   `static void impress_friends(void)`: `/arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c`. TODO why that name?

-   Morse code: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.2/arch/x86/realmode/rm/wakemain.c#L38

-   Kernel 4.0 `arch/Kconfig`:

        #
        # ABI hall of shame
        #

    Contains beautifully named configs like `CLONE_BACKWARDS`.

## Linux kernel

-   Ugly macros are a way of life.

-   The Linux kernel has `make clean`, but also a more radical clean called:

        make mrproper

    This is likely a reference to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Clean> in German (and Finnish?).

-   <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/ManagementStyle?id=v4.0>

-   End of kernel `CREDITS`:

        # Don't add your name here, unless you really _are_ after Marc
        # alphabetically. Leonard used to be very proud of being the
        # last entry, and he'll get positively pissed if he can't even
        # be second-to-last.  (and this file really _is_ supposed to be
        # in alphabetic order)

## Joke software

This will also include funny smoke tests:

    oneko

    sudo apt-get xeyes

    sudo apt-get install cmatrix
    cmatrix

    sudo apt-get install bb
    bb

### sl

For correcting people who change `ls` into `sl`.

    sudo apt-get install sl
    sl

Also see:

    man sl

### lolcat

Cat with diagonal rainbow colors:

    sudo apt-get install sl
    echo {a..z}{a..z}{a..z} | lolcat

## Easter eggs

Zen of Python:

    echo 'import this' | python

    firefox about:robots

    calendar
    calendar -f /usr/share/calendar/calendar.lotr -A 365

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugzilla#Zarro_Boogs>

### Super Cow Powers

### apt-get moo

Try:

    apt-get moo

Then:

    aptitude moo

says:

    There are no Easter Eggs in this program.

Boring... but wait! Try this:

    aptitude -v moo
    aptitude -vv moo
    aptitude -vvv moo
    aptitude -vvvv moo
    aptitude -vvvvv moo
    aptitude -vvvvvv moo
