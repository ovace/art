    Computers from the 80s had no multi-tasking.

    You just put a floppy disk in, and reset it.

-   Splat is a name for asterisk.

    Probably etymology: when a bug hits the car's window, it sounds like "splat",
    and the bug then looks like an asterisk.

-   Some dev put on his blog's tag line:

    The program and language used to generate the `info` manuals, official GNU doc tool.

    Initially coded by Stallman. Today, feels like it is only relevant as part of the GNU cult / dream, while `man` has dominated.

    It compiles natively to both HTML and PDF, but not `man`. In general, information on `info` manuals are great and filled with examples, unlike `man` manuals which are much more formal.

-   Tweets in Chinese can contain way more information since they are limited to 140 *Chinese* characters, and most Chinese words are 1 or 2 characters long!

-   LLVM compiles C, C++, etc. to a standard object code, somewhat like Java does, but the object code is meant to go through compilation after optimization.

-   Technical debt: when you implement fast but something without taking precautions like testing.

    This generates a cost for the future, which later you will have to pay in the form of bugs.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication>

    Uses multiple types of authentication amongst:

    - knowledge factors: something the user knows. Password.
    - possession factors: something the user has. Key, credit card, private RSA pair.
    - inheritance factors: something only the user can have. Biometrics and behavior metrics like signature.

    In software computing systems, the most common type if 2 factor authentication (2FA) with knowledge and possession factors of password and private key pair.

-   Very interesting IBM electro-mechanical typing machine mechanism: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Selectric_typewriter>

    Introduced in the 60's dominated the American market.

    Advantage: the entire font is contained in a single mechanical piece. Easy to change, harder to break.

### Stallman

"I have done your mother" reply to "what have you done?" in a context of comparison to Steve Jobs (TODO proof):

> Well rude comments don't deserve replies but I'll "come at you" anyway.

> Over my career I have tried to be an advocate of truely free software, I have have helped develop the GPL license, I have done most of GNU, a vital part of any system with the Linux kernel which runs on millions of computers around the world and disk space-wise is bigger, I have done your mother, and have also written and manager emacs for many years. I also have a good interest in foreign languages and Hungarian folk dancing.

### Jobs

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs>. So many interesting anecdotes.

Owned 7% of Disney through the Pixar merger...

### Grace Hopper

<http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper>

She said:

> It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.

which is now often used as a programming principle meaning that it is better to try and deal with exceptions than check if exceptions won't be raised.

### c2 wiki

<http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors>

2 letter domain!

The first wiki, the software is called <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb>

Many interesting programming discussions which is its original purpose.

Became read-only in 2014 because of vandalism.

## Strategy

## Design

I'm not a design person, but sometimes I'm surprised.

-   <https://design.ubuntu.com/brand> Ubuntu brand guidelines.

-   <http://railscasts.com/episodes/302-in-place-editing?view=asciicast>

    Used extensively on modern websites like GitHub and Stack Overflow.

    Greatly improves the user experience for almost all fields because it becomes
    much faster to edit: no need to reload the page every time.

    Cases where it cannot be used:

    -   huge textareas, specially ones where you would be tempted to enable ACE for, e.g. GitHub blob edit.

    -   objects that are version controlled and where you want to allow editing multiple fields on a single edit, operation e.g. Stack Overflow questions which have title, body and tags.

## iPhone

Impressive iOS feature to a programmer that never touched smartphones:

- fingerprint unlock
- continuity

Useful:
