Computer industry is crazy because it improved exponentially <https://youtu.be/bPFgWl6IWzw?t=456> This is how IBM broke.

## Sun

I feel this is a cool company that made lots of interesting software.

McNealy, co-founder, said:

> "The mistake we made was putting it on our own hardware. If we hadn't metal-wrapped it, it would have been more widely adopted. If we had put Solaris early on an Intel box, Linux never would have never happened."

And now Oracle continues selling it in their SPARC hardware...

If only they hadn't done that mistake, maybe Solaris would have dominated and prevent the current Linux distribution mess...

Sun also talked to IBM when selling out: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle>

## Intel

Founders were ex-Fairchild.

Started as a memory manufacturer, and grew in the 80's by supplying IBM with chips.

It is considered an IBM's greatest fault to have outsourced hardware to Intel, and operating system to Windows. Reminds me of the Sony / Nintendo breakdown at the CD revolution of the 90's, which enormously benefited Sony, and seriously hurt Nintendo which did not see the technological wave coming.

In the 90's, benefited enormously with the Windows partnership, labeled <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel>

In 2011, bough McAffee, which will be renamed to Intel security.

## Microsoft

How they got rich:

- Made BASIC interpreter that run on the first 8080 computer, reusing an 8080 simulator from a previous venture.
- IBM approached them when they wanted to get quickly into the PC market. They went in. But IBM also needed an OS. So they approached the top OS maker of the time. But he found it too restrictive, and drove IBM away. So Microsoft bought a clone of the OS, and sold it to IBM.
- then IBM outsourced their Windows replacement OS/2 to... Microsoft! Who at the same time started working on Windows... and then the partnership broke.

IBM's importance was so great to Windows that it is still referred to as PC by less technical people... which derives from IBM PC which DOS powered!

Microsoft sold lots of UNIX in the 80's: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix>

Nice resume of bad things they've done by an European study: <http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf>

<http://www.jonhs.com/mugshots/gates.htm>

### Windows

- DOS was the first major OS, which they've bought a clone of CP/M, the previous dominant OS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M>
    CP/M creator appears at: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYOW7gEdGMk>
- Windows was a DOS front-end until 1995
- Windows NT was a major revamp, started in 1988, it was first released in 1993, and Windows XP used it and was a major hit. It is also the core of Windows 7, Vista and 10.
- Windows CE: embedded compact version
- Xbox One has 3 OSes running at once virtualized! <http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-22/xbox-one-has-not-one-but-three-operating-systems.html>

## Apple

Made up by two Steve's.

They've made a failed video game console: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell> and the Byte shop were the first sellers. Jobs managed to get the parts for the first 50 computer batch on credit with only with the COD promise from the retailer, so they gave away no equity.

Shareholder number 2 at the IPO <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Markkula> was an angel investor. He got rich with shares from Fairchild which he got through marketing and "retired" at 32. Then he was lured out of retirement only to invest in Apple... Lol wasn't he rich enough?

10 initial employees: <http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-early-employees-2011-5?op=1&IR=T>

Apple only transitioned to Intel chips in 2005, from it's older <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC> (Apply / IBM / Motorola alliance made). So *this* is where PowerPC on the Linux kernel tree comes from.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Woz_Machine>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_screw> Even their screws are designed to prevent people from owning their products :-) Ah, looks like they are not alone: <http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1474:_Screws>

Amazing insider story of the Intel port: <https://www.quora.com/How-does-Apple-keep-secrets-so-well/answer/Kim-Scheinberg> Another one on that thread says that at the very early stages they had a sign on the entrance that said lose lips sink ships. They also mention products covered in black cloths when no one is working on them in case someone comes in by mistake.

Intel port 2005 announcement: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdTqnYnFyg> After he announces, he then reveals that the computer used for the slide presentation was an Intel CPU, and that OSX 10, then the last great update, was designed from the start for portability.

The prototype was done by one employee working on it full time for 18 months from 2000, and Jobs wanted Sony VAIO to ship it at first! <http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5380832/sony-vaio-apple-os-x-steve-jobs-meeting-report>

They design their own ARM CPU's: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A7> TODO since when?

OS X from 1999 was the first UNIX based OS they sold, which came from the NeXT buy.

XEROX, after inventing the GUI, Ethernet and OOP, kind of gave the GUI away to Apple. Apple took and commercialized it. As Jobs put it, the Apple 2 was running out of gas. Macintosh was the first GUI computer from Apple. It was named after the McIntosh apple cultivar: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntosh_%28apple%29>

Windows managed to gain market because:

- they had tons of applications from IBM compatibility
- they sold cheaper, partly because Intel owned Motorola which made the CPU of Apple (PowerPC predecessor)

They managed to take a bit back by selling to artists, who love a GUI.

Macworld Boston 1997-The Microsoft Deal <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxOp5mBY9IY> Bill Gate's Giant head on stage. Apple was out of cash, Jobs had just come back. And the Microsoft money saved them. That was before Apple's iPod and iPhone megahits, and when Microsoft was facing patent charges for stealing Apple's GUI.

Woz was an HP employee, and he offered Apple I to HP 5 times. He was obliged by hist contract. <http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/06/apple_co_founder_offered_first_computer_design_to_hp_5_times>

Apple licensed Basic from Microsoft.

The street of their headquarters is called <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Loop_%28street%29>

iPod history: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQwzI4kBG1o>

One of the major decisions when Jobs came back to Apple was reduce the number of products from 50 to 10. Focus is all.

Jobs elevator encounter: <https://www.quora.com/Who-did-Steve-Jobs-actually-fire-in-an-elevator>

### iPod

<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1224523/>

Napster was the spark for iPod: Jobs noticed the huge interest in music that it generated.

iTunes was built upon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundJam_MP , which was made by former Apple employees who made a new company.

The first ones were hard disk based!

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deopyTQOn7I> amazing keynote.

It was firewire based: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394> So it was binded to the iMac.

They had found a huge hole in the market. Do watch the keynote: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deopyTQOn7I>

The white earphones was not in the initial marketing effort, but it then became a brand stable.

Another defining thing is selling individual songs instead of albums and subscriptions, and it was really hard to fix a single price per record, which is a really consistent interface.

3rd generation introduced Windows compatibility.

After the initial success, they then made several variations, to satisfy all consumers.

## Fairchild

Father of Intel and AMD.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight>

The eight talk a bit: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLNh4UY5ohw>

Interesting point: the space race started with Sputnik shed federal money into the company.

Moore and Noyce made Intel and hold 4-7 B net worth each.o

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Kleiner became a notable early investor on top companies like Google and Sun.

The real revolutionaries 2009 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpGV9fhwzBg>

One of the big decisions of Shockley was to use Silicon.

## HP

-   <http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/earlyinstruments/0002/>

    Their first product was the master thesis of the founder.

    They've named it 200A instead of 001 or something, to make it seems like they had been around in business for some time.

## Facebook

- Bloomberg documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WiDIhIkPoM

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster one of the oldest big ones.

## Zynga

They've stolen Mafia wars and Farm Ville ideas from other games, but implemented them better.

## LinkedIn

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx6FZzW7vp0>

Blew up on the economic crisis, when people started looking for jobs.

I did not understand if there was a key differentiator, maybe they won because of great implementation, connections and previous capital.

## Netflix

His first enterprise was <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Software>

Founder's second company, started by sending CDs by physical mail! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix>

The hew small format was the key innovation! He bet on it early, before users had DVD players.

Killed Blockbuster and Hollywood video.

Subscription model was another great advance.

Almost died on the bubble.

Big competitors Blockbuster and Walmart and only started jumping in after the IPO, when they became more visible.

A price was started, and Netflix stock went down.

Netflix' inertia was too big.

And then, Netflix shifted from DVD to Internet, to finish the kill.

At the start of the internet video, the difficulties were:

- huge licensing fees for the best newest ones
- no one watched videos on PC, only television

## Twitter

Found first worked for O'Reilly. Then created Blogger, which Google bought.

Twitter started really early, before smartphones where up. This explains the 140 character limit, and why they've won. Limit was 160, and they've left a bit for the username.

## Compaq

How they got rich: made a reverse engineering of the IBM PC.

It was not impossible because IBM only had one part which was not off-the-shelf: the ROM BIOS using <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design>

Dell soon followed.

Intel just kept selling their CPU like hotcakes as no one could clone that.

## Foxconn

1M employees! Chinese iPhone making sweatshops.

## Netscape

Mozilla stands for Mosaic Killer, after Andressen left his previous university job <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEFu-B1wj1E>

Microsoft  then bought the original code from the university to compete!

Project Code Rush shows the end: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y>
