Computer industry is crazy because it improved exponentially <https://youtu.be/bPFgWl6IWzw?t=456> This is how IBM broke.

## Sun

Name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_Network

I feel this is a cool company that made lots of interesting software.

McNealy, co-founder, said:

> "The mistake we made was putting it on our own hardware. If we hadn't metal-wrapped it, it would have been more widely adopted. If we had put Solaris early on an Intel box, Linux never would have never happened."

And now Oracle continues selling it in their SPARC hardware...

If only they hadn't done that mistake, maybe Solaris would have dominated and prevent the current Linux distribution mess...

Sun also talked to IBM when selling out: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle>

## Intel

Founders were ex-Fairchild.

Started as a memory manufacturer, and grew in the 80's by supplying IBM with chips.

It is considered an IBM's greatest fault to have outsourced hardware to Intel, and operating system to Windows. Reminds me of the Sony / Nintendo breakdown at the CD revolution of the 90's, which enormously benefited Sony, and seriously hurt Nintendo which did not see the technological wave coming.

In the 90's, benefited enormously with the Windows partnership, labeled <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel>

In 2011, bough McAffee, which will be renamed to Intel security.

## Fairchild

Father of Intel and AMD.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traitorous_eight>

The eight talk a bit: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLNh4UY5ohw>

Interesting point: the space race started with Sputnik shed federal money into the company.

Moore and Noyce made Intel and hold 4-7 B net worth each.o

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Kleiner became a notable early investor on top companies like Google and Sun.

The real revolutionaries 2009 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpGV9fhwzBg>

One of the big decisions of Shockley was to use Silicon.

## HP

    Their first product was the master thesis of the founder.

    They've named it 200A instead of 001 or something, to make it seems like they had been around in business for some time.

## Facebook

- Bloomberg documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WiDIhIkPoM

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster one of the oldest big ones.

## Zynga

They've stolen Mafia wars and Farm Ville ideas from other games, but implemented them better.

## LinkedIn

Blew up on the economic crisis, when people started looking for jobs.

I did not understand if there was a key differentiator, maybe they won because of great implementation, connections and previous capital.

## Netflix

His first enterprise was <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Software>

Founder's second company, started by sending CDs by physical mail! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix>

The hew small format was the key innovation! He bet on it early, before users had DVD players.

Killed Blockbuster and Hollywood video.

Subscription model was another great advance.

Almost died on the bubble.

Big competitors Blockbuster and Walmart and only started jumping in after the IPO, when they became more visible.

A price was started, and Netflix stock went down.

Netflix' inertia was too big.

And then, Netflix shifted from DVD to Internet, to finish the kill.

At the start of the internet video, the difficulties were:

- huge licensing fees for the best newest ones
- no one watched videos on PC, only television

## Twitter

Found first worked for O'Reilly. Then created Blogger, which Google bought.

Twitter started really early, before smartphones where up. This explains the 140 character limit, and why they've won. Limit was 160, and they've left a bit for the username.

## Compaq

How they got rich: made a reverse engineering of the IBM PC.

It was not impossible because IBM only had one part which was not off-the-shelf: the ROM BIOS using <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design>

Dell soon followed.

Intel just kept selling their CPU like hotcakes as no one could clone that.

## Foxconn

1M employees! Chinese iPhone making sweatshops.

## Netscape

Mozilla stands for Mosaic Killer, after Andressen left his previous university job <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEFu-B1wj1E>

Microsoft  then bought the original code from the university to compete!

Project Code Rush shows the end: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y>
