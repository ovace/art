## Sun

I feel this is a cool company that made lots of interesting software.

McNealy, co-founder, said:

> "The mistake we made was putting it on our own hardware. If we hadn't metal-wrapped it, it would have been more widely adopted. If we had put Solaris early on an Intel box, Linux never would have never happened."

And now Oracle continues selling it in their SPARC hardware...

If only they hadn't done that mistake, maybe Solaris would have dominated and prevent the current Linux distribution mess...

Sun also talked to IBM when selling out: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle>

## Intel

Founders were ex-Fairchild.

Started as a memory manufacturer, and grew in the 80's by supplying IBM with chips.

It is considered an IBM's greatest fault to have outsourced hardware to Intel, and operating system to Windows. Reminds me of the Sony / Nintendo breakdown at the CD revolution of the 90's, which enormously benefited Sony, and seriously hurt Nintendo which did not see the technological wave coming.

In the 90's, benefited enormously with the Windows partnership, labeled <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintel>

In 2011, bough McAffee, which will be renamed to Intel security.

## Microsoft

IBM's importance was so great to Windows that it is still referred to as PC by less technical people... which derives from IBM PC which DOS powered!

Microsoft sold lots of UNIX in the 80's: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix>

## Apple

Made up by two Steve's.

They've made a failed video game console: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell> and the Byte shop were the first sellers. Jobs managed to get the parts for the first 50 computer batch on credit with only with the COD promise from the retailer, so they gave away no equity.

Shareholder number 2 at the IPO <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Markkula> was an angel investor. He got rich with shares from Fairchild which he got through marketing and "retired" at 32. Then he was lured out of retirement only to invest in Apple... Lol wasn't he rich enough?

10 initial employees: <http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-early-employees-2011-5?op=1&IR=T>

Apple only transitioned to Intel chips in 2005, from it's older <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC> (Apply / IBM / Motorola alliance made). So *this* is where PowerPC on the Linux kernel tree comes from.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_screw> Even their screws are designed to prevent people from owning their products :-) Ah, looks like they are not alone: <http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1474:_Screws>

## Fairchild

Father of Intel and AMD.

## HP

    Their first product was the master thesis of the founder.

    They've named it 200A istead of 001 or something, to make it seems like they had been around in business for some time.

## Google

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex is 10^Googol.
