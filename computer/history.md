-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse> early relay computer. Used binary, great advance over Babbage's machine.

    Also hole punched programmed.

    Then a friend came to him and said: use vacuum tubes instead, which is electronic instead of mechanic, and 1000x faster.

    In 41, Hitler though the war would end in 6 months, so no longer scale projects were undertaken.

    Americans then invented it to calculate firing tables.

    ENIAC was not electronically programmable: it had to be rewired.

    Von Neumann entered the project at the end.

-   definition on "computer" changed from person in 1935, to machine in 1945. Mentioned at: <https://youtu.be/4YArfOgjXys?t=1209>

    Co-invented by TI and Fairchild.

-   COBOL beat Fortran in early days because Fortran as too focused for number crunching, and had little letter support.

    COBOL, COmmon Business Oriented Language on the other hand, is really verbose and English-like.

    OK, so that is the origin. It was their first product, and they did a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_balloon> mode.

    They didn't even have the hardware, so they developed on top of an 8080 emulator Allen had written for a previous venture of theirs: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traf-O-Data>

    Intel just didn't see the power of their 8080 Chip , and continued to make it for calculators.

    <https://youtu.be/gBz8OFdAeQk?t=1525> mentions it.

    The creator of Altair didn't become rich, and became a doctor afterwards.
