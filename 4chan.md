# 4chan

Top level posts are images only.

Comments can have images or not.

When a comment is made, the thread is bumped.

If the thread leaves page 10, it is deleted. But there are of course archives.

Most notorious: Random: http://4archive.org/board/b Why called `b`? Because second board after `a` maybe: http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/why-is-4chan-called-b.179804009/

Each comment keeps links to:

- child comments
- a parent comments

To select parents, click the checkboxes before posting.

There is an auto checkbox to periodically update threads.

<http://boards.4chan.org/b/catalog> is a nice way to see all posts at once

All users are anonymous? You must enter a CAPTCHA for every post. There is a paid version that dispenses you from that.
