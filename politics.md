-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unparliamentary_language> Funny way to call it. And lists are so funny!

-   When you have a proposal, start by making it to people from the low level of the organization and then go up.

    This way, if you find that the idea is bad and stop at some point, big boss won't know and won't think bad of you.

    If the idea survives, you will know every argumentation line that is likely to come up.

    Specially important because the big decision makers don't have much time, so your proposal must be flawless when it reaches them.

    Coined by a Senator who said "a fellow from Texas can tell the difference between grass roots and AstroTurf... this is generated mail". He was describing a "mountain of cards and letters" sent to his office to promote insurance industry interests.
