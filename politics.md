# Politics

Politics, advertisement, law.

-   When you have a proposal, start by making it to people from the low level of the organization and then go up.

    This way, if you find that the idea is bad and stop at some point, big boss won't know and won't think bad of you.

    If the idea survives, you will know every argumentation line that is likely to come up.

    Specially important because the big decision makers don't have much time, so your proposal must be flawless when it reaches them.
