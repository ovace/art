# Microsoft

How they got rich:

- Made BASIC interpreter that run on the first 8080 computer, reusing an 8080 simulator from a previous venture.
- IBM approached them when they wanted to get quickly into the PC market. They went in. But IBM also needed an OS. So they approached the top OS maker of the time. But he found it too restrictive, and drove IBM away. So Microsoft bought a clone of the OS, and sold it to IBM.
- then IBM outsourced their Windows replacement OS/2 to... Microsoft! Who at the same time started working on Windows... and then the partnership broke.

IBM's importance was so great to Windows that it is still referred to as PC by less technical people... which derives from IBM PC which DOS powered!

- Windows was a DOS front-end until 1995
- Windows NT was a major revamp, started in 1988, it was first released in 1993, and Windows XP used it and was a major hit. It is also the core of Windows 7, Vista and 10.
