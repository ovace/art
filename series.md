### True detective

Note: 7.

Good. Some points a bit clich√© or overly dramatic,
but some smart moves like the shootout lying scene which echoes the Godfather's christening scene

The scenery is the most important thing in the series.

### Silicon Valley

Note: 7.

Quite realistic.

Some season 1 episodes lose the edge, but most were good.

### Star Trek

A few gem episodes still worthwhile today, but most not worth it.

### The Wire

Interesting to see how the high level semi-political policeman want to close cases as soon as possible even if it means letting the real deal go by just to save face.

- S01 E03: cool to see how hard it was to get the wire, even when it was obviously necessary.
- S01 E04: chess scene, speechless crime scene investigation
- S01 E05: "Major likes assets.", commenting on how taking away the gangster's buildings would bring money into the department.

- S02 E02: Amazing to see how the officers fight to get the murders to someone else's jurisdiction
- S02 E05: Omar's trial
- S02 E07: Funeral flower arrangements that look like guns to target drug dealers

- S03 E04: 10s silent investigation scene on Dee's "suicide"

### Rome HBO 2005

Note: 7

Watched: 2015-05

A bit exaggerated like most series, but did teach me a few things about politics and the Romans.
