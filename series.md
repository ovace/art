## Episodes worth my time

- Silicon Valley S01 E01 - E03
- Star Trek Original - The Naked Time, (Mirror, Mirror), A Taste of Armageddon
- Veep S01 E01, S01 E03, S03 E04

### True detective

Note: 7.

Good. Some points a bit clich√© or overly dramatic,
but some smart moves like the shootout lying scene which echoes the Godfather's christening scene

The scenery is the most important thing in the series.

### Silicon Valley

Note: 7.

Quite realistic.

Some season 1 episodes lose the edge, but most were good.

### Star Trek

A few gem episodes still worthwhile today, but most not worth it.

### The Wire

Interesting to see how the high level semi-political policeman want to close cases as soon as possible even if it means letting the real deal go by just to save face.

- S01 E03: cool to see how hard it was to get the wire, even when it was obviously necessary.
- S01 E04: chess scene, speechless crime scene investigation
- S01 E05: "Major likes assets.", commenting on how taking away the gangster's buildings would bring money into the department.

- S02 E02: Amazing to see how the officers fight to get the murders to someone else's jurisdiction
- S02 E05: Omar's trial
- S02 E07: Funeral flower arrangements that look like guns to target drug dealers

- S03 E04: 10s silent investigation scene on Dee's "suicide"

### Rome HBO 2005

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_%28TV_series%29>

Note: 7

Watched: 2015-05

A bit exaggerated like most series, but did teach me a few things about politics and the Romans.

### Narcos 2015

- bad guys need to get luck every time, good guys only once (police vs mafia)

## Cosmos a personal Voyage

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage

    The flashbacks into scientific discoveries are the best part of the series.

    Most interesting ones:

    - 1

    We are made of start stuff comes from it! http://www.cnet.com/news/we-are-made-of-star-stuff-a-quick-lesson-on-how/

    EP3: the gravitational influence of the obstetrician is much larger than that of Mars!

    EP5 44min: mixture of atoms to make a human!

    EP10: 19min: reenaction of Hubble's instrumentation

## Halt and catch fire 2014

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_%28TV_series%29>

- season 1: Compaq-like IBM PC cloning. Note: 8.
- season 2: beginnings of internet, AOL like company + later on PC becomes cheap on the guy (Dell-like) Note: 7: too much emphasis on medical / personal problems vs enterprise compared to first one, thus worse.

## Futurama

Good episodes;

- The Problem With Popplers

Meh:

- The Late Philip J. Fry

## Man in the high castle 2015

Note: 7

Too constructed. Cliche storm.

- "The accident".
- Girl torn between two guys. <http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoGuysAndAGirl>, <http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithAFriendAndAStranger> variety
- <http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin>

Main German / Japanese dialog is not in native language... which it would obviously be in.

Germans are more evil than the Japanese.

The bounty hunter gives me brain diarrhea.

Juliana gets government job with japs, even though she is trouble with the police?

Joe, after going undercover, goes to family lunch with his operator? Risk of getting caught?

## The Americans 2013

Some very good, others too exaggerated. Just skip exaggeration.

Bad episodes:

- s01e04: car jumping? really?? a bit too risky, no?
- s01e11: just fill up, nothing happens
- s02e01: meh

## Rick and Morty 2013

Note: 8

- s02e03
- s02e06
- s03e01

## Billions 2016

Note: 8

## American Gods 2017
