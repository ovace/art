    Four major element sources are known:

    - spontaneous formation after Big Bang: light elements
    - inside stars reactions: up to Iron.
    - inside supernovas: up to plutonium.

        Explains extra abundance of certain light elements.

    First discovered as a byproduct of nuclear reactions, then found in trace quantities in nature.

    Formed by the Big Bang, half life big enough to be observable today on Earth.
