-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element#Origin_of_the_elements>

    Four major element sources are known:

    - spontaneous formation after Big Bang: light elements
    - inside stars reactions: up to Iron.
    - inside supernovas: up to plutonium.
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_spallation>. Explains extra abundance of certain light elements.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_element>

    Formed by the Big Bang, half life big enough to be observable today on Earth.

        Became a pulsar.

    -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Supernova

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe TODO understand this.

    93 billion light-years

    There is more, but light has not reached us yet.

    More of the universe will become observable with time, but things far way enough will never be observable: they are moving "faster than light" because the universe expands.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_%28astronomy%29

    Until 1920, we were still not sure if there were other galaxies!

    Distance from a larger body at which a small body held together by it's gravity will decompose because of differential forces.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group>

-   Milky way

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way>

    100k light years diameter, 200 billion stars, 100 billion planets.

    The solar system is at 27 light years from the center.

    We are on the Orion Arm of the spiral: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm>, we turn once every 250M years.

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#/media/File:Milky_Way_Arms.svg>

    Nearest galaxies: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_galaxies>

    Andromeda is the closest major one, also spiral, 2.54Mly with about the same mass as us, and visible to the naked eye in moonless nights. We are going to collide in 3.8 billion years.

    We and Andromeda are the to major components of the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group>

-   Futuristic spacecraft:

    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion>
    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion>

    If close enough to light speed, we can reach the stars in a lifetime even if it is light years away, because of time contraction.

    With nuclear fusion, we could reach 10% speed of light, which is enough to travel our galaxy.

    Supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*>

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar>

    Weird radiation that does not follow element lines.

    Likely caused by accretion disks of supermassive black holes.

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_System> uses them as coordinates, because they are strong and punctual.

-   <http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/274-When-was-the-first-rocket-launched-into-space->

    V2 German was the first in 1942, Sputnik was the first to be actually launched in 1958.

    Rockets were first created for war.

-   Mars exploration.

    First reached in 1971 by the Russians.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_2#Post_encounter>

    First successful interplanetary non-manned mission. Observed Venus, which is the closest planet.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet

    Smallest known comet orbit, the only clearly visible and with several historical records, and the only that can be seen twice in a lifetime.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event#Frequency_and_risk Impacts are inversely proportional do the cube of the mass.

    1 km wide meteors every 0.5M years.

    5 to 10 km wide can cause mass extinctions.

-   Meteors:

    - 2013 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor>
    - 1908 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event>
    - -66M: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater> 10km wide impact
    - -300M: 2 10km impacts in Australia

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9 1993, first observed comet orbiting a planet and colliding, here Jupiter.

## Chemistry

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5p2yooC5fY> Liquid nitrogen triple point with vacuum pump.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium>

    First discovered as a byproduct of nuclear reactions, then found in trace quantities in nature.

    It decays too fast. It was first produced in considerable quantities in the 40's for the atomic bombs, where it was used.

    Guys talking about plutoinum: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89UNPdNtOoE>

    Interesting point: scientist wearing glove was pierced by a contamined needle. For the next 50 years, plutonium could be detected in his urine.

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site>

    Costs 4400 dollars per gram: <http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2008/AndrewMorel.shtml> Platinium is 33 :-)

    Produces helium from reations, which builds up pressure, and must be accounted for.
