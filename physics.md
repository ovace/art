Physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology.

    Four major element sources are known:

    - spontaneous formation after Big Bang: light elements
    - inside stars reactions: up to Iron.
    - inside supernovas: up to plutonium.

    Formed by the Big Bang, half life big enough to be observable today on Earth.

    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticality_accident>

        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ckdTlgvlU> British video from 69 that explains for employees the main factors of criticality:

        -   mass

        -   shape: more surface area allows for larger masses

        -   reflection: if you surround a mass with something that reflects neutrons, a smaller mass is enough.

            This is what caused: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core

            Note that there are several types of material properties related to neutrons:

            - no reaction
            - absorption
            - reflection

        -   concentration: fissile material is sometimes handled in solution form

            The Tokaimura accident happened when such solutions were being handled.

        -   moderator: if put into water, oil or graphite, neutrons move slower, and slow neutrons are much more likely to crash.

        So interesting: if you bring two pieces of he same size together, you're f***.

        But separately, you're fine.

        Accidents:
