-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element#Origin_of_the_elements>

    Four major element sources are known:

    - spontaneous formation after Big Bang: light elements
    - inside stars reactions: up to Iron.
    - inside supernovas: up to plutonium.
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_spallation>. Explains extra abundance of certain light elements.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_element>

    Formed by the Big Bang, half life big enough to be observable today on Earth.

    Yes, you can use lasers to cool atoms. Used to generate Bose Einstein condensates.

### Quantum

-   Black body radiation catastrophe solved by quantization of energy.

-   Photoelectric effect: light intensity does not matter to take electrons out of a metal, only frequency.

    Below a certain frequency, nothing happens, then electrons start popping out.

    Explanation: photons are discrete.

    Nowadays we can use very high intensities, and some electrons will come out, because there are so many that multiple ones can interact at the same time.

-   Double slit with one electron.

    Stern-Gerlach.

    Surprising to see the three magnet case vertical, horizontal, vertical.

-   Compton scattering. TODO

    Really quick video without much explanation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP8HmnuUFjA>

    Medium detailed setup, but looks not too complex. Hardest part must be the caesium.

    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticality_accident>

        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ckdTlgvlU> British video from 69 that explains for employees the main factors of criticality:

        -   mass

        -   shape: more surface area allows for larger masses

        -   reflection: if you surround a mass with something that reflects neutrons, a smaller mass is enough.

            This is what caused: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core

            Note that there are several types of material properties related to neutrons:

            - no reaction
            - absorption
            - reflection

        -   concentration: fissile material is sometimes handled in solution form

            The Tokaimura accident happened when such solutions were being handled.

        -   moderator: if put into water, oil or graphite, neutrons move slower, and slow neutrons are much more likely to crash.

        So interesting: if you bring two pieces of he same size together, you're f***.

        But separately, you're fine.

        Accidents:
