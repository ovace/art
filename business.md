-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_%28finance%29> how much the price varies.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity>: high liquidity means that you can sell quickly without reducing the price much.

    High liquidity exists when there are many buyers and few sellers.

    Money is what has the highest liquidity possible, as it can be traded for anything on the country where it is official.

    Gold is a staple of high liquidity product, since it can be easily melded to a standard form.

    Housing in areas with low desirability is a staple of low liquidity.

    On startup investment, only the big successes matter financially: 3/4 of Y combinator's money comes from Dropbox and Airbnb alone.

    The ideas that make huge companies don't seem good at first, or else someone else would have done them before. The author recalls how he felt about that at first about Facebook.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunt>, AKA marketing stunt.

    Short list of famous job application stunts: <http://jonbishop.co/want-a-chance-at-the-best-startups-go-beyond-the-resume/>
    Most failed.

    A dangerous publicity stunt is the central theme of the Safety last 1923 film.

-   Exit strategy.

    A way to get the money out of a company you've built by trading it entirely or parts of it.

    Common exit strategies are to sale, acqui-hire, IPO.

    Interesting article with a few methods: <http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/78512>

-   *Unicorn*: an exceptionally successful startup / entrepreneur, usually on the Billion Dollar range.

-   Delaware corporation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_corporation>

    The state of Delaware has 50% of all American corporations, and 60% of fortune 500s.

    It is a corporate haven.

-   hedge fund vs VC.

    hedge fund: everyone puts some money, and a manager decides entirely where to invest.

    VC: the investor himself (the VC) decides where to invest the money.

-   Acqui-hire: the larger guy buys you, but keeps you employed to keep running operations.

-   Business model.

    How you make money: what you charge or not for, how much.

    Examples:

    - payed
    - freemium: pay for some features only.
    - organization: donations
    - closed / open / semi open source

-   Roadmap.

    Longer term strategy: where you are moving towards.

-   Growth vs Profit? Offer free products so that you become more popular (growth) or charge people a lot and make short term profit?

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Business> vs funding: a process that is in a state that needs no external input.

    For an enterprise: they leave out of actual revenue, not investments.

-   <http://bestpitchdecks.com/> so *that* is the name of those startup one long page with lots of pictures showcase.

## Finance

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender> Stuff that can be used to pay, in special money.

    Things which are not tender: checks, credit cards, gold. Some countries however do have legal gold bullion coins.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullion_coin> Weird product: has legal tender way lower than the value of the material.

    Exists in England: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_%28British_coin%29>

### Future

### Derivatives

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange> major derivative market.

Good source: <http://commodities.about.com/od/understandingthebasics/a/What-Are-Derivatives.htm> 

The original application was to hedge agricultural products: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_%28finance%29>, which like insurances is a way of reducing risk for individuals. But it works differently from insurance.

Derivatives were then naturally extended to any underlying products besides agricultural ones: currencies, stock, etc. The actual thing to be traded is called the underlying.

In hedging, you make a contract with someone that you will sell at a given price in the future no matter the actual price in the future.

This guards seller and buyer against unpredictable price variations.

Similarly to stock, derivative markets have been created to give liquidity to derivatives, allowing people to buy derivative contracts from each other. Those markets are often called *commodity exchanges*, and the largest ones in the world are: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchanges#Commodity_exchanges>

## Stock exchange

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call>

    <https://investor.google.com/webcast.html>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange>

Market for stock trading.

The main reason of existence is increasing the liquidity of stocks.

### Opening times

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_exchange_opening_times>

All stock markets close on the weekends and at night.

- pre-market: 8 AM to 9:30 AM
- regular: 9:30 AM to 4 PM EST
- after-hours market: the rest of the day

Trading outside regular times is possible, but those are more volatile and less liquid. In the past, only institutions could trade on after-hours, but this is not true anymore, and the tendency with technology is towards 24/7 trading.

Why stock markets close despite all the automation: <http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/8950/why-is-the-stock-market-closed-on-the-weekend> Basically, a lot of the trading still needs manual intervention.

In the past, only institutions could trade

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization> share price times number of shares

    The total cap of a stock market is a significant economic measure, although it is susceptible to speculative spikes like the dot com bubble.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation> type of company that trades shares on a sock exchange.

    Incorporation is the act of becoming a corporation, and often (TODO always) happens through an IPO.

Closing price <http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp>. Value of actions when the stock closes.

### Dividend

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend> how much you get paid for you share.

Often expressed as the percentage of the stock that is paid.

Cash is the most common form of payment, but there are also payments by other means, such as giving more shares.

Companies declare individually when they will pay dividends: <http://www.investopedia.com/university/introduction-to-dividends/dividend-dates.asp> TODO what are the legal constraints? How often do companies usually do it?
