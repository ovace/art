# Rocket

The major manned projects were: Mercury (orbit), Apollo, and the Shuttles.

-   The control module used Hydrogen Oxigen fuel cells: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell Advantages:

    - Batteries and solar pannels are too heavy or large
    - fuel already used for propulsion
    - reaction produces water

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1> First artificial satelite. By the Russians in 1957. Started the space race.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury>

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Seven> First men in orbit.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apollo_missions>

    Apollo 11 to 17 were meant to land on the moon. Only 13 aborted.

    1 through 10 were successive rehearsals, each going further than the last. Apollo 10 went around the moon and came back.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1> Was going to be a low orbital flight. But during a reharsal a fire killed the 3 men crew...

-   Apollo 4 was a rocket test, and it worked, the first USA orbit.

    Apollo 6, which was supposed to be the same as 4, had serious failures, but still barely worked.

    Apollo 8 was the first human flight.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11> Made of 3 parts. One orbited the moon, while the third went to the moon, and came back to meet it!

    They've made progressive missions with the lunar module. Apollo 9 orbited earth, 10 the moon, and only 11 landed.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12>

    First color camera on the moon. But the astronaut destroyed it by pointing it to the sun.

-   Apollo 13: Huston we've got a problem. So they did not touch the moon.

    Numerologists must have gone mad on this one.

    Two days before launch, one of the original crew members was grounded because of measles suspect. It did not happen however. He later went to the moon: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Mattingly>

    Reentry-footage: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX8-Vmys-Fk>

-   Apollo 15: first to have the lunar car.

-   After Apollo 17: no man has been outside of lower Earth orbit as of 2015 since!

    Why not again:

    - robots can do the job now
    - the new goal is sustaining a month long mission on the moon

-   The americans kickstarted their space program with German V2 WW2 rocket technology, in particular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun . He was SS.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_set> Underwater technology played a role in space suit design.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_test>

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_program> First close up pictures of the moon. Crashed directly into it.

## Shuttles

NASA built 6 shuttles: ships that could be reused. First launched in 1977: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter>

2 were destroyed at some point killin the 7 crew members: Challenger on Launch, Columbia on Re-rentry.

The last ones were decomissioned in 2011.
