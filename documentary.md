## General Idi Amin Dada 1974

Note: 8

Because he did not like the editing of the film, he rounded up 200 French citizens in Uganda and threatened to kill them unless the film was edited as he liked it.

Best moments:

- a television editor that worked for Dada made a mistake, which was identified by the director of this film.
