    Important in Japanese culture, features in Nintendo video games, in particular Super Mario Bros. 3 there is a Tanooki suit which allows you to fly and turn into stone.

    Tanookis are said to shapeshift using leaves into other forms to cause mischief, thus the relation to flying (power by leaves) and the Tanooki turning into stone.

    Has been criticized by animal rights: <http://features.peta.org/mario-kills-tanooki/>
