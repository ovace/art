Often called "IMG" by those familiar.

Bought MIPS Technologies, makers of the MIPS ISA.

Makes PowerVR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerVR> TODO alternatives?

Intel owned 16% of it's shares as of 2009.

Mostly sells IP core it seems.

In 2015, 50% of smartphones use it, Apple looks like a big customer.

Dreamcast used it.

UK based at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Langley> 30 min from London by train, 1h from Cambridge by car.

Got a few GCC commits in 2015, a few Binutils in 2013, a few linux Kernel in 2015 (one of the top linux kernel sponsors in 2015 <https://github.com/cirosantilli/bak/blob/master/2015-who-writes-linux.pdf>)

## Apple acquisition

Since Apple is a major customer, there is talk that it could buy IMG at some point.

<http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/05/09/after-failed-takeover-talks-with-apple-imagination-technologies-sells-3-stake-to-state-owned-chinese-company>

One major blocker of this acquisition seems to be MIPS, which is 30% of IMG, and not of interest to Apple.

So Apple has been poaching IMG people individually: <http://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/13/apple-imagination-technologies-hires/>

Apple seems to have a completely custom shader core: <http://www.realworldtech.com/apple-custom-gpu/>

## Competitors

Other low power GPU IP companies:

- ARM holdings
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivante_Corporation USA

## Demos

2015 discussion of products: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtU0ac1RvpY> , shows Apple tablet, LG phone, Kindle Fire, Dell. Covers high ranges.

There is also ARM and x86 integration with PowerVR.

MIPS is used in <https://www.engeniustech.com/> tablets.
