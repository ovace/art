I have a soft spot for Chinese language and traditional culture.

I might include Japanese / Korean / Vietnamese stuff here too because they are all inside the Sinosphere.

Chinese can count up to 10 with **one hand**: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_number_gestures>. Every Chinese knows those signs and uses them instinctively.

#Numbered lists

Chinese people love to enumerate common concepts.

This tendency also exists in other cultures, but it is specially strong in the Chinese culture.

This is a list of some of the most important and interesting ones.

#Chess

In [Chinese Chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi) (象棋, Xiàngqí) it is possible to do triple and quadruple checks. They are not blockable. In Western chess, only double checks are possible.

The cannon / catapult is a very funny piece which can only capture if there is a piece blocking its path.

The river, board middle line, affects 2 pieces: the elephant cannot cross it, and soldiers who cross it can move sideways.

In [Japanese Chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi#Drops) (将棋, shōgi), you can use one of your turns to put a captured piece into any position of the board.

Every piece can be promoted to an new one with specific new moves (most of them equal to another piece) when they reach the further third of the board, not just the last line as in occidental chess. Pieces are then turned over to show the promoted side.

##China the Roots of Madness {documentary}

Wiki: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China:_The_Roots_of_Madness>

Despite possibly biased and CIA made, but it is full of videos and photos, and individual facts and testimonies seem true.

##Japan's role

It seems that the Japanese played a role in dividing China. Perhaps if they hadn't attacked, Sun Yat sen would have been able to unify China, and they couldn't have invaded.

Mao was more firm in saying that civil war with Sun Yat sen should stop to beat the Japanese. This made important allies with northern military under invaded Japan.

The fight against Japan also centered people under his command.

Japan focused attacks on the cities controlled by Chiang, weakening him more than Mao.

##Sun Yat sen

He manages to be currently both officially praised by China and Taiwan!

His main goal was to modernize China, getting it rid of Imperialism and local warlords.

He took Communist Russian help to beat the warlords, but I don't yet understand if it was just for the weapons or if he was really communist. It seems that Chinese propaganda and Taiwan public opinion diverge on this point.

Lily Sun, his granddaughter disagrees with China's interpretation, and denied an official request to take part into recent Chinese propaganda for Sun Yat Sen

After he died, his movement seems to have split up into communist and Chiang Kai-shek anti communism.

Mao came out of this on the Communist side. His strategy was to appeal to the peasants to fight a guerrilla war by destroying modern means of transport and communication. His force was not in the big modernizing cities, but in the hatred of the peasants.

##Chiang kai-shek

He was married to an educated American Chinese woman, which reinforced his link to the West.

##Mao

It is incredible how Mao was able to survive impossible situations, and chose the right strategies to become the supreme ruler of China.

The great march was his amazing successful escape from Chiang's impending attack.

His peasant guerrilla strategy was also rather successful against technically superior Japan. His force was in the large amounts of people, not in high tech.

After WW2, Mao and Chiang agreed to peace under American supervision: saw each other face to face and discussed for 6 weeks. However, as Japanese withdrew, both started getting ready for war: American backed Chiang, and Russia backed Mao.
