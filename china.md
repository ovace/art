I have a soft spot for Chinese language and traditional culture.

I might include Japanese / Korean / Vietnamese stuff here too because they are all inside the Sinosphere.

#Numbered lists

Chinese people love to enumerate common concepts.

This tendency also exists in other cultures, but it is specially strong in the Chinese culture.

This is a list of some of the most important and interesting ones.

#Chess

In [Chinese Chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi) (象棋, Xiàngqí) it is possible to do triple and quadruple checks. They are not blockable. In Western chess, only double checks are possible.

The cannon / catapult is a very funny piece which can only capture if there is a piece blocking its path.

The river, board middle line, affects 2 pieces: the elephant cannot cross it, and soldiers who cross it can move sideways.

In [Japanese Chess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi#Drops) (将棋, shōgi), you can use one of your turns to put a captured piece into any position of the board.

Every piece can be promoted to an new one with specific new moves (most of them equal to another piece) when they reach the further third of the board, not just the last line as in occidental chess. Pieces are then turned over to show the promoted side.
