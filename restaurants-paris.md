### Introduction

I am strongly biased towards Chinese food, and I think it is the best option to eat in Paris.

Paris has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China, and there must be around 10~20 restaurants which serve food unlike anything you have ever eaten.

**Important**: for all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions. Tell him that you:

- want the most typical dishes, **not** what the French eat, but what the **Chinese** eat
- can eat spicy food, way more than any French person can. The term is either "zhong1 la2" for most restaurants, and "wei4 la4" for very spicy places. If you can't, learn to eat spicy, or you will miss many of the best dishes.

**Traiteur**: traiteurs are simpler restaurants that let you see pre-made food and choose how big your portions will be. They are the best way to eat a cheap and balanced meal in Paris, but generally not considered *great* Chinese food.

So called **"Asian"** restaurants which mix either of Chinese / Japanese / Vietnamese / Thai are very rarely very good. Conversely, restaurants that specialize in a single region of China are more likely to be good (bot not certainly good). It is already difficult to do the cuisine for one part of China well, imagine for multiple countries.

    3 Rue Voltaire
    75011 Paris

    Food from the Hakka people <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakka_people>

    Most dishes are like other good Chinese restaurants in Paris, but there were a few different ones.

-   Royal Tching Tao (青岛人家)

    8 Rue du Bel-Air - 75012 Paris

    - Galettes croustillantes au canard. Shi zi tou.
    - Sweet fish （Song shu gui yu 松鼠桂鱼)

-   Deux Fois Plus De Piment (绝代双椒)

    Address: 33 Rue Saint-Sébastien - 75011 Paris

    Sichuan style.

-   Tien Hiang (天香)

    14, rue Bichat - 75010 Paris

    Vegetarian food: most dishes are an imitation of a dish with meat.

    Not as good as the original meat for me, but very interesting and good for a change.

    Chinese vegetarians are rare. In theory, the origin of the food in this restaurant is Hong Kong Buddhism (Buddhist monks cannot eat meat, while other believers can.)
