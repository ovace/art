### imgur

Image board.

Porn accepted.

Possible to download entire albums at once. Nice.

Albums can have title / comment metadata.

No album fork / clone feature? https://community.imgur.com/t/clone-album/593

### Anonymous albums

Can create anonymous albums <http://imgur.com/a/fuofI> they go under `/a`.

They can be modified by the same browser, after a short period, a cookie "login"? Identical uploads generate different IDs, but does not seem sequential, maybe a hash that includes time? <http://imgur.com/a/F2NFH>

## Anonymous text sharing

- <http://pastebin.com>
    - can paste without login
    - IDs seem sequential, not hashes
    - can clone / fork pastes
    - search seems to work on paste and title metadata, but indexing takes a while
    - no comments

## Instagram

Porn: no.
