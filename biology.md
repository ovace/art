-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromacy> Almost all placental mammals. Exceptions
    - primates closely related to humans, which are usually trichromats
    - sea mammals (both pinnipeds and cetaceans) which are cone monochromatsi
    - New World Monkeys are a partial exception: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering>. Babies don't shiver.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue>. There are two types. This one is common in newborns, which don't shiver, and hibernating mammals.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kava>. Mistyped Java.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish>. Only vertebrate that has a skull and no spinal cord and no pineal gland.

    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish#Commercial_use> says that only one species is eaten, and in particular the slime it produces is used in a similar way to egg white. The hide can also be used for wallets.

    It is also served while moving in the plate: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjxxOSu40Y8>

    And the slime can suffocate the attacker: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqk0mnMgwUQ&list=PLmQzYrtR9NBQ8fpE22UDOPqXRyJhPPtFP>

    It just waits at the bottom for up to 6 months without eating for a dead animal to drop nearby.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan>

    The black swan, an Australian species, was though not to exist in the past in England, which lead to expressions in England such as the "black swan" philosophical question.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis>

    Giving birth without sex.

    Mammals: no natural case.

    Lizards, birds, and simpler all have.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid>

    Many species have more than 2 pairs of each chromosome:

    - plants: several, including crops. Durum wheat is the only tetraploid wheat variant.
    - animals: there are 12 ploid lizards, but no functional mammals with more than 2. Some experiments have made some, but they don't live to birth / long.

        Mamals have monoploid reproductive cells.

    - prokaryotes: all monoploid.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_Test>

    Color blindness test, made popular on the web as an amusement.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness>

    The informal term "Daltonism" for color blindness comes from the same Dalton who researched into atoms, who had the condition and studied it.

    The most common type of color blindness is Deuteranomaly, present in 5% of European males. It affects red-green discrimination, but does not prevent it entirely.

    There are rarer conditions in which red receptors are completely missing, in which red-green discrimination is impossible.

## Rare animals

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_IUCN_Red_List_Critically_Endangered_species>

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_giant_softshell_turtle> only 4 known, if you count the one in Vietnam which the Vietnamese say it's another species. 2 at Suzhou, and we hope they feel like breeding some day...

    2016 update: the Vietnamese died: <http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/beloved-giant-turtle-dies-leaving-three-alive-earth-180957940/?no-ist>

## Plants

-   baobab

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhL00xqj1ek> In some regions of Madagascar, they use it to store water!

    The trunk is very humid, like a sponge: <https://youtu.be/yhL00xqj1ek?t=558>

    It seems to survive, and keep the water good for a long time.

    Their main amusement was telling each other their dreams. They were hypnotized by television, and could not help themselves watching even though they considered it sinful.

    He did not believe that man had set foot on Earth, but he quickly accepted satellites since themselves had noticed stars that were moving too fast, and he conjectured that hey were man generated.

    A transparent cellophane package:

    > Lord, what have they thought up; it is glass, but it crumples!

    He mentions that at first the family would accept only a single gift: salt. This is also comes up on a Japanese film I saw where when the soldier finally finds salt he eats it pure and cries of pleasure.
