    Giving birth without sex.

    Mammals: no natural case.

    Lizards, birds, and simpler all have.

    Many species have more than 2 pairs of each chromosome:

    - plants: several, including crops. Durum wheat is the only tetraploid wheat variant.
    - animals: there are 12 ploid lizards, but no functional mammals with more than 2. Some experiments have made some, but they don't live to birth / long.

        Mamals have monoploid reproductive cells.

    - prokaryotes: all monoploid.

    Color blindness test, made popular on the web as an amusement.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness>

    The informal term "Daltonism" for color blindness comes from the same Dalton who researched into atoms, who had the condition and studied it.

    The most common type of color blindness is Deuteranomaly, present in 5% of European males. It affects red-green discrimination, but does not prevent it entirely.

    There are rarer conditions in which red receptors are completely missing, in which red-green discrimination is impossible.
