-   Species with very few specimens:

    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_IUCN_Red_List_Critically_Endangered_species>

    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_giant_softshell_turtle> only 4 known, if you count the one in Vietnam which the Vietnamese say it's another species. 2 at Suzhou, and we hope they feel like breeding some day...

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-wine_stain>

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering>. Babies don't shiver.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue>. There are two types. This one is common in newborns, which don't shiver, and hibernating mammals.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kava>. Mistyped Java.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish>. Only vertebrate that has a skull and no spinal cord and no pineal gland.

    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagfish#Commercial_use> says that only one species is eaten, and in particular the slime it produces is used in a similar way to egg white. The hide can also be used for wallets.

    It is also served while moving in the plate: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjxxOSu40Y8>

    And the slime can suffocate the attacker: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqk0mnMgwUQ&list=PLmQzYrtR9NBQ8fpE22UDOPqXRyJhPPtFP>

    It just waits at the bottom for up to 6 months without eating for a dead animal to drop nearby.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footedness>

    Only half of left handers are also left footed.

    90% of right handed people are also right footed.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan>

    The black swan, an Australian species, was though not to exist in the past in England, which lead to expressions in England such as the "black swan" philosophical question.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis>

    Giving birth without sex.

    Mammals: no natural case.

    Lizards, birds, and simpler all have.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid>

    Many species have more than 2 pairs of each chromosome:

    - plants: several, including crops. Durum wheat is the only tetraploid wheat variant.
    - animals: there are 12 ploid lizards, but no functional mammals with more than 2. Some experiments have made some, but they don't live to birth / long.

        Mamals have monoploid reproductive cells.

    - prokaryotes: all monoploid.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_Test>

    Color blindness test, made popular on the web as an amusement.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness>

    The informal term "Daltonism" for color blindness comes from the same Dalton who researched into atoms, who had the condition and studied it.

    The most common type of color blindness is Deuteranomaly, present in 5% of European males. It affects red-green discrimination, but does not prevent it entirely.

    There are rarer conditions in which red receptors are completely missing, in which red-green discrimination is impossible.
