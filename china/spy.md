-   Chinese defectors:

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yonglin>. Espionage accusations.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiang_Wenhao> 1989, pilot in the plane to Taiwan. A money prize was paid at the time for defectors. Airplanes also had an anti-defection system, but it did not work very well that time.

    -   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xuecheng> 1983, pilot in plane to Taiwan. Received the standard 3000 taels gold prize by the Taiwan government given to defectors.

        Interesting to see the defection method, in particular how he waited for a chance to leave in an exercice where there were no wingmen, and when he had extra fuel.

        Taiwan and China used different radio requencies, so he had to communicate to the Taiwanese pilots who came to check him that he was a peaceful defector and that he had low fuel only with airplane and hand gestures.

        Also interesting to see how he conserved fuel by firing all of his ammunition.

    It's "fun" to watch how people escape a dictatorship to tell the truth / get money.

    China's reply strategy is to discredit the person as being at a lower Government level than actual, and charges of corruption.

    There are many cold war / dictatorship pilot defection precedents: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_MiG_behind_the_Iron_Curtain>
