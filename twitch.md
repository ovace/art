<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch.tv>, spinoff of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv>, 2007 and Y-Combinator backed.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifecasting_%28video_stream%29> was the initial idea, and co-founder <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Kan> is noted for doing it at first.

Bought by Amazon in 2014 for 1B. Google was going to buy it through Youtube for the same price, but backed out for fear of anti-trust.
