My literary interests are similar to my film interests.

## George Orwell

### 1984

Note: 9

Author: George Orwell

Year: 1949

Insights into communism.

Communism is harder to kill than a one man dictatorship because it is a dictatorship of an entire class.

## Animal farm

Note: 8

Year: 1945

Insights into communism.

The communist leader creates a mystical aura around him, and at a certain point stops appearing in public.

## For Whom the Bell Tolls 1940

Note: 8

Author: Hemingway

Insights into peasant revolutions and Russian war.

High points:

- characters: Robert, Pablo and Pilar are very deep
- chap 10: the horrors of the beginning of the peasant revolt, and how their honorable revolution turned into barbarity fueled by drunkenness
- chap 18: Gaylord and the reality of the lying, good living, Russian-backed revolutionary elite

Low points:

- Maria and romance. If I wanted a romance, I'd read one. This just dilutes what really matters: the war.

## The stranger 1942

Note: 8

Many of us feel like he does I guess.

## Brave new world

Note: 7

Insights into communism / dictatorship / technology dystopia. But less vivid than 1984.
