My literary interests are similar to my film interests.

## George Orwell

### 1984 1949

Note: 9

Author: George Orwell

Insights into communism.

Communism is harder to kill than a one man dictatorship because it is a dictatorship of an entire class.

Winston's clarity is amazing:

> we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long
life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will
understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the
past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who
resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the
Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never
had the courage to recognize their own motives

## Animal farm 1945

Note: 8

Insights into communism.

The communist leader creates a mystical aura around him, and at a certain point stops appearing in public.

## For Whom the Bell Tolls 1940

Note: 8

Author: Hemingway

Insights into peasant revolutions and Russian war.

High points:

- characters: Robert, Pablo and Pilar are very deep
- chap 10: the horrors of the beginning of the peasant revolt, and how their honorable revolution turned into barbarity fueled by drunkenness
- chap 18: Gaylord and the reality of the lying, good living, Russian-backed revolutionary elite

Low points:

- Maria and romance. If I wanted a romance, I'd read one. This just dilutes what really matters: the war.

## The stranger 1942

Note: 8

Many of us feel like he does I guess.

The book's general feeling have a name of a branch of philosophy: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism>, of which Camus was a proponent.

## Brave new world 1931

Note: 7

Insights into communism / dictatorship / technology dystopia. But less vivid than 1984.
