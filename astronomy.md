    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse There are two phases: umbra and penumbra.

    The moon becomes red because the sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere to reach it.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_%28moon%29

    Largest Neptune moon: turns retrogradely! So likely came from outside.

-   Supernovas:

    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Nebula>

        11th century Chinese recordings.

        Became a pulsar.

        In the milky way.

    -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Supernova

        17th century, visible for 3 weeks during the day.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray Largest energy: 50J == a baseball at 90 KPH!!!

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_%28cosmology%29 378k years old.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe TODO understand this.

    93 billion light-years

    There is more, but light has not reached us yet.

    More of the universe will become observable with time, but things far way enough will never be observable: they are moving "faster than light" because the universe expands.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_%28astronomy%29

    Until 1920, we were still not sure if there were other galaxies!

    It was not his major goal, but became the major reason he is still known https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0nq7OD1rVM

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude intrinsic measure of luminosity at fixed distance.

    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude>

        Up to 6 visible to the human eye.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit

    Distance from a larger body at which a small body held together by it's gravity will decompose because of differential forces.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group>

-   Milky way

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way>

    100k light years diameter, 200 billion stars, 100 billion planets.

    The solar system is at 27 light years from the center.

    We are on the Orion Arm of the spiral: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm>, we turn once every 250M years.

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#/media/File:Milky_Way_Arms.svg>

    Nearest galaxies: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_galaxies>

    Andromeda is the closest major one, also spiral, 2.54Mly with about the same mass as us, and visible to the naked eye in moonless nights. We are going to collide in 3.8 billion years.

    We and Andromeda are the to major components of the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group>

-   Futuristic spacecraft:

    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion>
    -   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion>

    If close enough to light speed, we can reach the stars in a lifetime even if it is light years away, because of time contraction.

    With nuclear fusion, we could reach 10% speed of light, which is enough to travel our galaxy.

    Supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*>

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar>

    Weird radiation that does not follow element lines.

    Likely caused by accretion disks of supermassive black holes.

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_System> uses them as coordinates, because they are strong and punctual.

-   <http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/274-When-was-the-first-rocket-launched-into-space->

    V2 German was the first in 1942, Sputnik was the first to be actually launched in 1958.

    Rockets were first created for war.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_2#Post_encounter>

    First successful interplanetary non-manned mission. Observed Venus, which is the closest planet.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halley%27s_Comet

    Smallest known comet orbit, the only clearly visible and with several historical records, and the only that can be seen twice in a lifetime.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event#Frequency_and_risk Impacts are inversely proportional do the cube of the mass.

    1 km wide meteors every 0.5M years.

    5 to 10 km wide can cause mass extinctions.

-   Meteors:

    - 2013 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor>
    - 1908 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event>
    - -66M: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater> 10km wide impact
    - -300M: 2 10km impacts in Australia

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9 1993, first observed comet orbiting a planet and colliding, here Jupiter.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Great_Red_Spot a little storm.

-   Outcomes of gravitational collapse:

    -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star , balanced by neutron degeneracy
    -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf , balanced by electron degeneracy

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_supernova

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Supernova 1606, largest and only certain one to be seen, 20k light years away. Lasts months.

## Mars exploration

First reached in 1971 by the Russians.

    I like the money usage split:

    - 1/3 for current telescope time
    - 1/3 to develop new telescope tech
    - 1/3 for astronomers
