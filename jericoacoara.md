Built with European investments, in particular Italian and French around 2000s. Many hotel owners have migrated from those countries.

Original interest for the interest: wind surfing / kite surfing. The wind is super strong here, and the beaches very long, so it is a perfect spot.

Fortaleza to Jericoacoara: found a cab for 350 to Jijoca + 20 / person on a 4x4 to Jericoacoara.

The only interesting things there are the dunes. Beaches are same / worse than in Sao Paulo state and much harder to reach, unless you care about wind / kite surfing.

Could not observe stars as I'd hoped. Place might be isolated enough from light pollution, but seems that clouds formed every night at this time of year. Local told me that in other months, you can see it beautifully.
