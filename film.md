## Bestof lists

Bestof lists which I generally approve:

- Criterion Collection: almost anything is watchable: <http://www.criterion.com/library/list_view?b=Criterion&p=1&pp=all&s=spine>

## Facts

- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_persons_fictitious_disclaimer>: use started after a 1932 MGM movie Rasputin and the Empress was sued for suggesting sexual assault of a living princess. I don't see how such superficial notices could avoid a law suite, since what you actually do is more important than what you say you do. This is probably why there have been so many ironic uses for it.

- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Idi_Amin_Dada:_A_Self_Portrait>: because he did not like the editing of the film, he rounded up 200 French citizens in Uganda and threatened to kill them unless the film was edited as he liked it.

## Quotes

Once upon a time in the west:

- looks like we're short one horse
- 42: inside them there were three men, inside them there were 3 bullets.
- 1:06: its almost like holding a gun. Only much more powerful.
- 1:50: there were no dollars on 'em' days
- 2:14: so you found out you weren't a business man after all.

## Best scenes

### Life of Brian

- stoning
- Biggus Dickus

### Turn up to 11

Expression generated by the Spinal Tap film: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven> has entered the Oxford dictionary. I say it used on a programming documentation.

On its primary page for the This Is Spinal Tap, IMDb displays the user rating for the film out of 11 stars (e.g. 8.0/11) instead of the standard scale of one to ten: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/>!

As a consequence of the film, real bands and musicians started buying equipment whose knobs went up to 11, or even higher, with Eddie Van Halen reputedly being the first to do so.

## Misc

- 9: I love it

Longer comments:

### The spy who came from the cold 1965

Depicts many interesting intelligence techniques.

I ask myself if such intricacy level was ever achieved in reality, but I do believe in the individual pieces.

Give a German alias to a German spy, it's less conspicuous.

The philosophical end dialog is beautiful.

- How big does your cause have to be before you start killing for it? What about your Party? There's a few million bodies on that path.
- What rules do you play by? Expediency.

### Man from Earth 2007

Note: 8

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Earth>

The writer, <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bixby>, is the same person who wrote the Star Trek "Mirror, Mirror" episode.
