Paris has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China, and there must be around 10~20 restaurants which serve food unlike anything you have ever eaten.

**Important**: for all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions. Tell him that you:

- want the most typical dishes, **not** what the French eat, but what the **Chinese** eat
- can eat reasonably spicy food. If you can't, learn to eat spicy, or you will miss many of the best dishes.

**Traiteur**: traiteurs are simpler restaurants that let you see pre-made food and choose how big your portions will be. They are the best way to eat a cheap and balanced meal in Paris, but generally not considered *great* Chinese food.
