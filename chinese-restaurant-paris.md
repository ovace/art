Paris has one of the largest Chinese communities outside of China, and there must be around 10~20 restaurants which serve food unlike anything you have ever eaten.

**Important**: for all restaurants, ask the waiter for suggestions, and tell him that:

- you want the most typical dishes, *not* what the French eat, but what the *Chinese* eat
- that you can eat reasonably spicy food (if you can't, learn)
