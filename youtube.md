## Ads

YouTube cuts 45% of the add pay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diPHM0l8zFU CPM is per thousand, not million...

Many views (%50 ?) are in platforms not monetized, e.g. TODO: Android app? still valid?

This claims 2CPM average in 2015: <https://medium.com/@hankgreen/the-1-000-cpm-f92717506a4b#.94vxlpage>

Created 1 month after YouTube, but in Paris by six guys who pooled 6k Euros.

Obviously did not get the same traction as YouTube in the valley + post PayPal connections.

Orange bought it for 120M. French government blocked Yahoo buy.
