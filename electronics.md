## Physics

Impedance: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance> Extends resistance to AC.

### Synthesis

### How to make actual chips

- <http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/37146/how-do-i-design-my-very-own-arm-based-processors> insanely good answer.

- <http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/7042/how-much-does-it-cost-to-have-a-custom-asic-made>

Concepts:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_cell>

FPGA is a simple way to run VHDL on hardware, but expensive, so one must make ASICs with them.

There is no synthesis open source option.

## Certifications and standards

Selling electronics requires certification from governments.

Logos certification logos can often be seen on the outside of electronics products and individual components. 

### CE

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking>

Europe.

`Conformité Européenne`, European Conformity in French.

### FCC

USA.

Federal communications commission.

### AWG cable

## Arduino

101 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F054MNB1QI

Minimal "Arduino" built from basic components (specially the micro controller) on a breadboard: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNIMCdVOHOM>

Not possible to run Linux on it: http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13/what-does-it-take-to-compile-linux-on-arduino-if-at-all-possible

Emulation: http://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/61/can-i-program-for-arduino-without-having-a-real-board

Uses Java (for GUI?), compiles programs with `avr-gcc`.

## Chip series

Those are famous series, mostly used historically, but which are still useful to learn chip design patterns.
