-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T> ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector.

    Maintains standards named as X.YYY, where X is a letter and Y digits, e.g.:

    -   ITU E.212 for SIM cards https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity
    -   H.264 for MPEG

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_sign> jargon for URL in fields like Amateur radio.

    Top understanding (*copy* in MC jargon) speed: certainly 40 wpm, possibly up to 72.

    Sending speeds: certainly 20 wpm is common.

    Compare to:

    - reading: 250 wpm at 70% comprehension for average adults, speed reading courses claim 500 wpm at same comprehension.

    Writing speeds TODO:

    - keyboard typing speed: depends on text type.

        - 163 WPM SXSW competition
        - 150 WMP over 50 minute periods by Stella Pajunas on Dvorak

    - keyboard numerical pad: 8k - 10k cph (133 cpm, 26 wpm at 5 chars per word) required by many jobs.

    - hand writing:

        - average adult: 31 wpm for memorized text, 22 while copying.
        - stenography methods: up to 350 wpm in shorthand competitions.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph>

    Wide class of communication methods that don't exchange solid objects, including:

    -   smoke signals

    -   reflected light as in the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliograph>

    -   electricity, starting with the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_telegraph> and culminating in the Internet.

        Weber and Gauss were amongst the first implementors of a practical system.
