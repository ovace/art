## Materials

-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg2WzCzKpYU Old chemist playing with large ammounts of super expensive metals like platinum output from a factory.

    Same with gold: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTtf5s2HFkA All gold extracted up to today would take up 20x20x20 cube meters.

    Cool to see how platinum is turned into a cloth for reactions.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_glass To make very flat glass, it is poured on top of liquid tin, where it floats and does not mix. This method was discovered only in the 50's.

    Copper. Can be either smelted or electrolyzed.

    Main usage: electricity wires and pipes. Why used for pipes vs PVC: <http://www.ehow.com/about_6452842_copper-used-water-pipes_.html>

-   Putting pieces of metal together:

    -   Welding:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_welding

    -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet

        Heavier than welding.

-   Ways to shape metal:

    - forge: heat it up and beat it into shape
    - cast: melt it and pour into a mold. Much easier to make, but brittle. Beating up the iron gives it better properties.
    - spin it and cut it round with a sharp tool
    - wire and sheets: heat it and pass it through increasingly small rounded compressors

    Iron ores:

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cuJKSQZ0k> Modern production, History channel

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3rjjpuhCLI> Iron production middle ages Netherlands.

    Interesting parts:

    -   at the source of extraction, there is: magnetic separation.

        Some level of preprocessing is done, which raises the iron content and generates iron pellets.

        Those are then transported to the furnace.

    -   At the very beginning, iron was made from meteors? TODO check.

    -   Iron was harder to produce than copper because it melts at a higher temperature 1,538C

        You have to push oxigen into the furnace to reach that temperature.

        Compare it to bronze at 1,085

    -   WW1 helmets were made to shield from debris from explosions, not bullets. Before that, helmets had not been used for some time.

    -   Mars is red because of iron oxide.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_spinning>

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal#Aluminium>

    Before electricity, aluminium was more expensive than gold, even though it is very abundant on the earth's crust.

## Rocket

The major manned projects were: Mercury (orbit), Apollo, and the Shuttles.

-   The control module used Hydrogen Oxigen fuel cells: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell Advantages:

    - Batteries and solar pannels are too heavy or large
    - fuel already used for propulsion
    - reaction produces water

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1> First artificial satelite. By the Russians in 1957. Started the space race.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury>

    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Seven> First men in orbit.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apollo_missions>

    Apollo 11 to 17 were meant to land on the moon. Only 13 aborted.

    1 through 10 were successive rehearsals, each going further than the last. Apollo 10 went around the moon and came back.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1> Was going to be a low orbital flight. But during a reharsal a fire killed the 3 men crew...

-   Apollo 4 was a rocket test, and it worked, the first USA orbit.

    Apollo 6, which was supposed to be the same as 4, had serious failures, but still barely worked.

    Apollo 8 was the first human flight.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11> Made of 3 parts. One orbited the moon, while the third went to the moon, and came back to meet it!

    They've made progressive missions with the lunar module. Apollo 9 orbited earth, 10 the moon, and only 11 landed.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_12>

    First color camera on the moon. But the astronaut destroyed it by pointing it to the sun.

-   Apollo 13: Huston we've got a problem. So they did not touch the moon.

    Numerologists must have gone mad on this one.

    Two days before launch, one of the original crew members was grounded because of measles suspect. It did not happen however. He later went to the moon: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Mattingly>

    Documentary with lots of footage: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiu2NfBAFLg>

    Reentry-footage: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX8-Vmys-Fk>

-   Apollo 15: first to have the lunar car.

-   After Apollo 17: no man has been outside of lower Earth orbit as of 2015 since!

    Why not again:

    - robots can do the job now
    - the new goal is sustaining a month long mission on the moon

    <http://heiwaco.tripod.com/reentry2.jpg>

-   The americans kickstarted their space program with German V2 WW2 rocket technology, in particular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun . He was SS.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_set> Underwater technology played a role in space suit design.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_test>

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_program> First close up pictures of the moon. Crashed directly into it.

### Propellants

### Shuttles

NASA built 6 shuttles: ships that could be reused. First launched in 1977: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter>

2 were destroyed at some point killin the 7 crew members: Challenger on Launch, Columbia on Re-rentry.

The last ones were decomissioned in 2011.
