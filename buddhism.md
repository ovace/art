9 years on a cave.

### Transmission

Bodhidharma asked, "Can each of you say something to demonstrate your understanding?"

Dao Fu stepped forward and said, "It is not bound by words and phrases, nor is it separate from words and phrases. This is the function of the Tao."

Bodhidharma: "You have attained my skin."

The nun Zong Chi stepped up and said, "It is like a glorious glimpse of the realm of Akshobhya Buddha. Seen once, it need not be seen again."

Bodhidharma; "You have attained my flesh."

Dao Yu said, "The four elements are all empty. The five skandhas are without actual existence. Not a single dharma can be grasped."

Bodhidharma: "You have attained my bones."

Finally, Huike came forth, bowed deeply in silence and stood up straight.

Bodhidharma said, "You have attained my marrow."

        Two monks were watching a flag flapping in the wind. One said to the other, "The flag is moving."
        The other replied, "The wind is moving."
        Huineng overheard this. He said, "Not the flag, not the wind; mind is moving."

Two hands clap and there is a sound. What is the sound of one hand? - Hakuin Ekaku

If you meet the Buddha, kill him. (逢佛殺佛，逢祖殺祖) - Linji

A monk asked Dongshan Shouchu, "What is Buddha?" Dongshan said, "Three pounds of flax."
