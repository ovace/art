# Sikh temple

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdwara>

Sikh temples offer free food every day to those in need.

I went to such a temple just outside of Paris on Sunday with an Indian friend at the address:

16-18 rue de la ferme  
Bobigny 93000

They serve free food every day, specially for those in need, but on Sundays, the food is better than other days, and families come to socialize. Children can be seen running around hapilly everywhere.

At the temple entrance, there are some chairs, so that you can take off you shoes, and give them to a volunteer who manages a locker.

Then, you should wash your feet on a small specialized feet washing basin, and cover your hair with an orange scarf if you are a man, since Sikhs cannot cut or show their hair in public. Orange is a symbols of Sikhsm.

It was amazing to wash the great ability with which men would wash their feet by rubbing themselves together, which I felt is comparable to the ability with which I wash my hands.

Next, we went up to a prayer room filled with people sat down, man and women separated on each side. We heard prayers a bit, and touched the sign twice with everyone else as a sign of respect at certiain points of the prayer.

We offered some coins in an offer box, before the altar holding Sikh symbols: mostly swords and shields.

At the exit of the prayer room, a man offered us a sweet paste made of milk and cashew nuts.

We went into the dining room, where men and women also sat separately in long rows on the floor. We had metal plates, a spoon and a metal glass: Indians often eat with metal utensils only.

Men passed periodicaly offering the food. My friend told me it would extremely impolite to show the plate when you want food: a simple look, word and smile would suffice.

The food was simple and similar to other typical indian food I had eaten and very good. Dahl, bread, vegetables, yogurt and a sweet.
