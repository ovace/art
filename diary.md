Talked on Skype with WriteLaTeX John Lees-Miller,
W3C editor Robin Berjon, MathJax fred-wang and other similar minded people.

I told Berjon about the IETF desire to standardize a Markdown MIME-type,
he immediately replied: what good is it to have a MIME-type for an underspecified
format? Exactly what I had thought at first. He's sharp.
