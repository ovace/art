## 2014-06 Mozilla Sprint 2014

Talked on Skype with WriteLaTeX John Lees-Miller,
W3C editor Robin Berjon, MathJax fred-wang and other similar minded people.

I told Berjon about the IETF desire to standardize a Markdown MIME-type,
he immediately replied: what good is it to have a MIME-type for an underspecified
format? Exactly what I had thought at first. He's sharp.

## 2014-11-25 Dancing with little Chinese girl

I was dancing in Place de la Republique, when a small girl came with her mother.

The girl started watching me, then came over. I looked at the mother to see if it was OK, she smiled, and so I started dance / playing with the little girl.

Her happiness was so pure and intoxicating, not a trace of violence in her action, pure carelessness. And on top of that she was East Asian, which is my weakness, her mother, who wore a hijab http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24118241, later told me they were from Singapore.

When her mother said it was time to go, she didn't want to leave.
