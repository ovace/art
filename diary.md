## 2014-06 Mozilla Sprint 2014

Talked on Skype with WriteLaTeX John Lees-Miller,
W3C editor Robin Berjon, MathJax fred-wang and other similar minded people.

I told Berjon about the IETF desire to standardize a Markdown MIME-type,
he immediately replied: what good is it to have a MIME-type for an underspecified
format? Exactly what I had thought at first. He's sharp.

## 2014-11-25 Dancing with little Chinese girl

I was dancing in Place de la RÃ©publique, when a small girl came with her mother.

The girl started watching me, then came over. I looked at the mother to see if it was OK, she smiled, and so I started dance / playing with the little girl.

Her happiness was so pure and intoxicating, not a trace of violence in her action, pure carelessness. And on top of that she was East Asian, which is my weakness, her mother, who wore a hijab http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24118241, later told me they were from Singapore.

When her mother said it was time to go, she didn't want to leave.

## 2014-12-12 Interview at QuartetFS

Today I did my second job interview with the branch head of the enterprise QuartetFS, and he said he will send me a contract tonight. A few thoughts which I had heard many people talk about before, but now have I felt more strongly than ever.

-   I had a friend from university who works for the company, John. He gave me the email of his boss. If I didn't know him, the most likely path of entry would be through a recruitment agency who contacted me. Another friend, which is a capable as I, was contacted for this job, but was rejected after this interview. I got lucky.

    The interesting thing is that I wasn't making a huge effort to find a job, and had turned down three recruitment agencies who contacted me before because I found that the jobs, while financially and carrier-wise good, were not very interesting.

    It was after getting contacted by one of those recruitment agencies that I contacted John, who had casually told me he worked on a similar thing earlier, asking if it was the same, and he said no, I work for another one. I asked if they were hiring, he asked his boss and said yes and gave me the email.

    I sat on that email for three months, until I met John by chance on the subway, he told me how everything was going fine at the company, and I decided to apply.

    Me and John were not super close friends. I never called him or anything. But I had always felt an affinity for the guy, for some unexplainable reason. I always enjoyed talking to him when we met, more than average with other people. It was this unexplainable affinity that led not only him to give me the contact of his boss, but also me to look more into his company and actually notice that they were doing very interesting things.

    Like minded people get together. You don't even have to make an effort.

-   While you are talking, the interviewer is taking notes.

    The importance of what you say to him is proportional to the speed at which he jumps to take the note.

    Some of the questions I expected him to take note, but I was surprised by how fast he noted a few others:

    - when talking about motivation to improve the world, I said that my parents have a very high moral standard
    - when asked how I chose the enterprise, I said I mostly excluded I didn't want to do
    - school grades (B / C but never flunked)
