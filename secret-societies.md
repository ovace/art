    Similar pseudo secrete organizations with around 1M members, some religious like rituals with or without beliefs, and with a stated purpose of helping their communities.

    In practice, it is likely that those organizations strongly endorse acceptance of the most rich or powerful members of society, and that one major reason why people participate in them is to help themselves.

    In short: like an organized religious cults, but with less emphasis on superstitious beliefs, and more emphasis on elitism and secrecy.
