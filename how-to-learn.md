# Why learn

- beautiful: some stuff is beatiful to learn
- useful: for society, and for yourself (if you help others you feel well and get money to survive).

# English

If you don't know English, you cannot make any real developments on any knowledge domain.

Learn English before you do anything else.

Write only in English.

Read in English instead of other languages if you have the choice. This is rarely the case as everything is in English.

# What to learn?

Decide what you should learn.

Best method: look at course lists for top universities. Try to follow it in the same order as the people in that course.

If things stop making sense, look up courses for high school for the bases.

Lists of top universities by subject: <http://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings>. Subjective but good enough for our purposes.

# How to learn

## Find the sources

Once you have decided the subject, find all the best sources like books or tutorials on the subject.

For certain subjecs you really need non-free books.

Sometimes there are small tutorials which clarify points that most books don't.

How to find the best books:

- see the bibliography for university courses. Go into the websiets for each course.
- put the subject name on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and see the top books.
- [google](https://google.com) `SUBJECT best books`, or `SUBJECT best tutorials` or `SUBJECT best free books`.

## Get the sources

- buy it new
- buy it used, even if an older version
- go to a library

A good method to search by ISBN.

The ISBN is a unique identifier of a book in 10 charcters.

You can find ISBNs on Amazon.

For example for [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-James-Stewart/dp/0538497815) the isbn can be found at `ISBN-10: 0538497815`.

This way you can compare prices across many sites for the exact same book.

Do *not* download material illegally via methods like:

- Torrent
- upload sites. Most of those have links coming from irresponsible blogs.

since this bankrupts publishing companies, and inhibits the creation of new books.

## Use the sources

First look quickly at all of the sources one by one to find which one seems more interesting, only then go for it.

Start with sources that are:

- simple
- concrete with lots of examples
- motivational

and *not* too theorethical.

If things stop making sense, try for 5 more minutes, and then jump:

- forwards
- backwards
- to another book

If you could not understand something, it is because there is someting else missing, possible from another source.

Don't wast too much time stuck on a single point: when you less expect you will find the answer.

## Write tutorials

Whenever you learn something, *write it down*  on your computer and publish it online to help others and make you famous.

Search for existing tutorials and contribute to them.

Best method: GitHub + Markdown or similar.

Whenever there is a point you don't understand, create a `TODO` and explain you problem in as much detail as you can.

Example:

    1 + 1 = 2 TODO why?

This will make it clear to you and to others what is not certain.

## Contribute on forums

E.g.: Stack exchange.

Don't waste your time refreshing the main page, but if you find a better solution for something post it.
