## Open source

-   Binary userspace driver blobs and kernel driver source for free download from: <http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/>
-   the kernel side source or part of it was released under the GPL:
    - http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/open-source-mali-utgard-gpu-linux-kernel-drivers/
    - http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/previous-releases/open-source-mali-gpus-linux-kernel-device-drivers-previous-releases/
-   Phoronix says the driver cannot be accepted into the kernel mainline without an open userspace to support it, as it cannot be used directly without that: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTY3OTM
-   the userland part of the driver is available only as binary blobs at: http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/arm-mali-midgard-gpu-user-space-drivers/
-   examples on the SDK: <http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/sdks/opengl-es-sdk-for-linux/> Also has emulator libraries to run without the GPU. TODO: emulator means software renderer? Possibly it is: <http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/tools/opengl-es-emulator/> which implements OpenGL ES with OpenGL.

## Mali money making

- <http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/24357.php>: 2009, 18
- <http://www.anandtech.com/show/7112/the-arm-diaries-part-1-how-arms-business-model-works/2>: adds 0.75% - 1.25% royalties

## Mali with non-ARM

- Intel ATOM x3 (announced 2015): <https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2015/04/09/introducing-intel-atom-x3-code-named-sofia-soc-processor-series>
- TODO Mips Mali?

## ARM with non-Mali

Any mobile design without Mali:

- Apple (PowerVR)
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Vita>
- Qualcomm Adreno

## FalanX

## History

FalanX founders:

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioblazevic

Jørn Nystad, Mario Blazevic, Edvard Sørgård and Borgar Ljosland are mentioned at http://www.digi.no/artikler/arm-kjoper-norsk-teknologiselskap/280866 They are centered at: NTNU https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_University_of_Science_and_Technology

Trondheim is a techno pole of Norway. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Semiconductor> is a notable predecessor company to FalanX. The BBC Micro Bit uses a Nordic SoC.

## Architecture

2014 ARM given high level overview up to T760: <http://www.anandtech.com/show/8234/arms-mali-midgard-architecture-explored/4>

T6xx GPUs implement cores in core "groups" with a maximum of 4 cores in any given group. So if you have 6 cores, it appears as 2 OpenCL devices! <https://community.arm.com/thread/6945>

## Reverse engineering

<http://limadriver.org/> Mali 200 and 400 only.

FOSDEM 2013 Lima driver presentation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z6xjIRXcp4>, also talks about reversing efforts of all other major mobile GPUs.
