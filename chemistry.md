    I like how liquid nitrogen looks just like water.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium>

    First discovered as a byproduct of nuclear reactions, then found in trace quantities in nature.

    It decays too fast. It was first produced in considerable quantities in the 40's for the atomic bombs, where it was used.

    Guys talking about plutonium: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89UNPdNtOoE>

    Interesting point: scientist wearing glove was pierced by a contamined needle. For the next 50 years, plutonium could be detected in his urine.

    Costs 4400 dollars per gram: <http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2008/AndrewMorel.shtml> Platinium is 33 :-)

    Produces helium from reactions, which builds up pressure, and must be accounted for.

## Materials

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium_magnet

    Discovered in 1982 by GM and some Japanese!

    Later bought by Hitachi. Hard drives use it.

    Basically the strongest magnet widely available today.

    Same with gold: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTtf5s2HFkA All gold extracted up to today would take up 20x20x20 cube meters.

    Cool to see how platinum is turned into a cloth for reactions.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_glass To make very flat glass, it is poured on top of liquid tin, where it floats and does not mix. This method was discovered only in the 50's.

    Copper. Can be either smelted or electrolyzed.

    Main usage: electricity wires and pipes. Why used for pipes vs PVC: <http://www.ehow.com/about_6452842_copper-used-water-pipes_.html>

        Heavier than welding.

-   Ways to shape metal:

    - forge: heat it up and beat it into shape
    - cast: melt it and pour into a mold. Much easier to make, but brittle. Beating up the iron gives it better properties.
    - spin it and cut it round with a sharp tool
    - wire and sheets: heat it and pass it through increasingly small rounded compressors

    Iron ores:

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cuJKSQZ0k> Modern production, History channel

-   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3rjjpuhCLI> Iron production middle ages Netherlands.

    Interesting parts:

    -   at the source of extraction, there is: magnetic separation.

        Some level of preprocessing is done, which raises the iron content and generates iron pellets.

        Those are then transported to the furnace.

    -   At the very beginning, iron was made from meteors? TODO check.

    -   Iron was harder to produce than copper because it melts at a higher temperature 1,538C

        You have to push oxigen into the furnace to reach that temperature.

        Compare it to bronze at 1,085

    -   WW1 helmets were made to shield from debris from explosions, not bullets. Before that, helmets had not been used for some time.

    -   Mars is red because of iron oxide.

    Before electricity, aluminium was more expensive than gold, even though it is very abundant on the earth's crust.
