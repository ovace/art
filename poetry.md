#Origin of the passion

> When did it start?
> Those days I'd hide myself in the library...
> ... of the maths department. So silent, away from the world. Pure knowledge.
> ... in the library of my high school. So few books, desire for more. The pleasure of closing it with the library lady.
> In bed with my parents, while they read and I bothered them. I felt so safe. They've planted the seed in my head.

#The boy who swallowed the world

> Inside the cube
> the quest goes on
> the source flows infinite,
> and there is neither rest,
> nor the rest.
>
> The eye that sees all is restless,
> and through thin air he lets in
> Most of which
> flows past.
>
> Others may reach him
> but their power is limited,
> by what they desire
> and their possessions.
>
> And so beauty follows the curve
> from nothing to nothing.
