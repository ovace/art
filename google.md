## History

Official take: <https://www.google.com/about/company/history/>

-   One of the great innovations was to give results directly to users, instead of trying to keep them on a website for as long as possible.

-   First investment: they were sitting on the front of a professor's house on a Sunday morning, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim Sun co-founder came along, tried it for 10 minutes, and wrote an 100k check.

    They didn't have a company yet, and couldn't cash the check. There is a Silicon Valley allusion to that.

    Bezos from Amazon also put early 250k.

    Then came Sequoia and KP well known venture firms. They wanted an exclusive deal, but Googlers said no: joint only, to keep one VC from controlling all.

    They also kept adds small, and separated them from search results, unlike other competitors at the time.

    The money came with AdWords because people would search, and the adds would target well whatever they searched. So it is much easier for companies to get adds, than targeting for example a individual websites.

    From the beginning they put huge emphasis on great employee conditions.

    The VCs pushed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt He was older, more experience, and more patient, which is needed to deal with some more traditional clients. They joked he was adult supervision.

    Sergei, son of Russians, was specially against Chinese censorship requirements.

    Microsoft launched Bing in 2009, and it helped Google dodge monopoly charges.

-   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex is 10^Googol.

    Carl Sagan mentions it in Cosmos Ep. 9.

They reused many of Sgi's buildings https://youtu.be/oOe05w1gLrE?t=429 which at it's time, was a had a comparable feeling.

## Blogger

Google groups was another company that Google bought Deja Usenet, written in Java: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups>

It was just a web interface for Usenet, and still holds classic Usenet discussions like Torvalds vs ast https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.minix/wlhw16QWltI[1-25]

It seems that the Usenet was one of the major public discussion places. In particular for the development of programming languages.

## Photos

Was <https://picasaweb.google.com/home>, then became a <https://photos.google.com> mess after Google + ... many features removed.

## Chrome

Chromium was also created by Google as the open source "code dump" version and unstables.

Unlike Android it does accept external contributions: <https://www.chromium.org/developers/contributing-code/external-contributor-checklist>

### Webkit

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit>

In 2001 Apple forked it from a KDE component. It made bad merge-backs, and eventually stopped.

In 2005 Apple open sourced it.
