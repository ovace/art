# Film

## Bestof lists

Bestof lists which I generally approve:

- Criterion Collection: almost anything is watchable: <http://www.criterion.com/library/list_view?b=Criterion&p=1&pp=all&s=spine>

## Jargon

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_relief>
- [Splatter, gorno, torture porn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatter_film)
- [snuff films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snuff_film): real deaths caught on tape
- [Stock footage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage)
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slasher_film>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docudrama>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movie>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_film>
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_character>

## Misc

- American Age Rating System: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rated_PG>

- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_persons_fictitious_disclaimer>: use started after a 1932 MGM movie Rasputin and the Empress was sued for suggesting sexual assault of a living princess. I don't see how such superficial notices could avoid a law suite, since what you actually do is more important than what you say you do. This is probably why there have been so many ironic uses for it.

## Tech

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DX>

### Star wars

Han shot first: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xezn-0xottw>

### Once upon a time in the west

Note: 9

- looks like we're short one horse
- 42: inside them there were three men, inside them there were 3 bullets.
- 1:06: its almost like holding a gun. Only much more powerful.
- 1:50: there were no dollars on 'em' days
- 2:14: so you found out you weren't a business man after all.

### Life of Brian

Note: 7

Some moments are amazing, but the most part is not.

Best moments:

- stoning
- Biggus Dickus

### Spinal Tap

Note: 11 (OK, 7)

### The spy who came from the cold 1965

Note: 8

Depicts many interesting intelligence techniques.

I ask myself if such intricacy level was ever achieved in reality, but I do believe in the individual pieces.

Give a German alias to a German spy, it's less conspicuous.

The philosophical end dialog is beautiful.

- How big does your cause have to be before you start killing for it? What about your Party? There's a few million bodies on that path.
- What rules do you play by? Expediency.

### Man from Earth 2007

Note: 8

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Earth>

The writer, <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bixby>, is the same person who wrote the Star Trek "Mirror, Mirror" episode.

### Battle Royale 2000

Note: 8

Forget the big evil guy and the super intelligent nerd and it's great.

#### Turn up to 11

Expression generated by the Spinal Tap film: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven> has entered the Oxford dictionary. I say it used on a programming documentation.

On its primary page for the This Is Spinal Tap, IMDb displays the user rating for the film out of 11 stars (e.g. 8.0/11) instead of the standard scale of one to ten: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/>!

As a consequence of the film, real bands and musicians started buying equipment whose knobs went up to 11, or even higher, with Eddie Van Halen reputedly being the first to do so.

### Hunger games

Clear influence from 1984, and he 1984 1984 movie.

#### Hunger games 1

Note: 7

Date: 2012

Despite being an unintentional copy of Battle Royale, it is still quite good.

#### Hunger games 2

Note: 7

Date: 2013

Slightly less focused than the first, but also good.

#### Hunger games 3 2014

Note: 4

Sucks. Too much cheap psychology, too little action. I only finished it because I was in the cinema with my GF...

### Munich 2005

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_%28film%29

Note: 7

Good, but greatly weakened by the fake French freelance intelligence sellers "Le Group": http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/life_and_art/2005/12/the_history_behind_munich.html

### Bicentennial man 1999

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Man_%28film%29

Note: 7

Reviews were very bad, but my GF recommended and I found it really not bad!

This falls in our view intersection: it has the tech component which interests us both, and a certain "the world has a fixed order", "people are simple faceted" type of feel good American feeling which soothes us.

### Full Metal Jacket 1987

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket

Note: 7, 8 for the training first half.

The only thing that spoils the training half is Pyle. His madness feels too fake and visible.

### Apollo 13

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13_%28film%29

Note: 8

Fact or fiction:

- <http://www.universetoday.com/101531/ken-mattingly-explains-how-the-apollo-13-movie-differed-from-real-life/>

### Maze Runner 2014

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner_%28film%29>

Note: 6

Watchable because of high action content, but too nonsensical to interest me.

A mixture of Jurassic park and Hunger games.

Generic good looking loved-by-all-except-bad-guy overly talented white hero with a girl, blodie bad guy, hordes of dying generic people, and the useless asian / black / indian / fattie supports...

### Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind>

Note: 8

### The 36th Chamber of Shaolin 1978

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_36th_Chamber_of_Shaolin>

Note: 7

Note: 8 for the training scenes.

China.

### The Road Home 1999

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Home_%281999_film%29>

Note: 7

### Farewell My Concubine 1993

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farewell_My_Concubine_%28film%29>

Note: 8

### Crimson Peak 2015

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Peak>

Note: 6

Boring cliché.

### Gravity 2013

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_%28film%29>

Note: 7

Interesting way of filming. Not too cliche.

### Pirates of Silicon Valley 1999

Note: 6, 7 if you have great interest in computers.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley>

<https://archive.org/details/Hack_-_Pirates_Of_Silicon_Valley_#>

Shows how Apple and Microsoft started out. The cool thing is to feel the environment those guys lived in.

Actors themselves are too exaggerated I think.

### Inglorious bastards 2009

Note: 8

### Of Gods And Men 2010

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Gods_and_Men_%28film%29>

Note: 7
