# How to learn anything

## Why learn

Humans have a single motivation in life: **become powerful**.

Learning is no different:

- **useful**: improve food, housing, health, etc. for others
- **beautiful**: teach others so they feel the beauty

Helping others makes you feel good and get money.

## Why not to learn

- make video games
- win at knowledge Olympics

## English

If you don't know English, you cannot make any real developments on any knowledge domain: **you are useless**.

Learn English before you do anything else.

Write only in English.

Read in English instead of other languages if you have the choice. This is rarely the case as everything is in English.

## What to learn

Use the top-bottom approach:

- first decide something exciting that you want to to
- then learn whatever is needed to do it

*not* the other way around, which is how formal education works

- first learn a bunch of generally useful stuff
- then some day hope to magically arrive at the final goal

Reason: if you don't focus on your goal, you will learn tons of things which don't matter to achieve it.

And once you *feel the need* for one of the basic subjects for the third time, you will doubly motivated to learn it, and will end up learning it.

Visualisation:

    Goal

Step 1:

    Goal
    |
    +-- Requirement 1
    |
    +-- Requirement 2

Step 2:

    Goal
    |
    +-- Requirement 1
    |   |
    |   +-- Requirement 1 1
    |   |
    |   +-- Requirement 1 2
    |
    +-- Requirement 2
    |   |
    |   +-- Requirement 2 1
    |   |
    +---+-- Requirement 2 2

Repeat until you reach requirements that you can tackle directly.

## How to learn

### Text is better than video

Text is faster to edit, takes less memory in your computer, downloads and uploads faster and is easier to search.

A sequence of perfectly chosen images at beats any video visualization.

If you have the choice, choose books over videos: get familiar with the superior medium.

### Find the sources

Once you have decided the subject, find all the best sources like books or tutorials on the subject.

For certain subjects you really need non-free books.

Sometimes there are small tutorials which clarify points that most books don't.

How to find the best books:

- see the bibliography for university courses. Go into the websites for each course.
- put the subject name on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and see the top books.
- [Google](https://google.com) `SUBJECT best books`, or `SUBJECT best tutorials` or `SUBJECT best free books`.

### Get the sources

- buy it new
- buy it used, even if an older version
- go to a library

A good method to search by ISBN.

The ISBN is a unique identifier of a book in 10 characters.

You can find ISBNs on Amazon.

For example for [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-James-Stewart/dp/0538497815) The ISBN can be found at `ISBN-10: 0538497815`.

This way you can compare prices across many sites for the exact same book.

Do *not* download material illegally via methods like:

- Torrent
- upload sites. Most of those have links coming from irresponsible blogs.

since this bankrupts publishing companies, and inhibits the creation of new books.

### Use the sources

First look quickly at all of the sources one by one to find which one seems more interesting, only then go for it.

Start with sources that are:

- simple
- concrete with lots of examples
- motivational

and *not* too theoretical.

If things stop making sense, try for 5 more minutes, and then jump:

- forwards
- backwards
- to another book

If you could not understand something, it is because there is something else missing, possible from another source.

Don't wast too much time stuck on a single point: when you less expect you will find the answer.

### Write tutorials

Whenever you learn something, *write it down*  on your computer and publish it online to help others and make you famous.

Search for existing tutorials and contribute to them.

Best method: GitHub + Markdown or similar.

Whenever there is a point you don't understand, create a `TODO` and explain you problem in as much detail as you can.

Example:

    1 + 1 = 2 TODO why?

This will make it clear to you and to others what is not certain.

### Contribute on forums

E.g.: Stack exchange.

Don't waste your time refreshing the main page, but if you find a better solution for something that was already asked, or have a new question that has never been asked, post it.
