# People know the best

When you are born, you don't know what is better, and anything goes.

But as soon as you find something better, everything changes, and anything less good torments you.

Found the best dish, no other tastes good.

Found the best work method, all others annoy.

Found the best art (Mathematics), all others bore.

Found the best belief, all others are meaningless.

Found the best woman, no other can tempt.
