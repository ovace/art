# The Four Treasures of the Hacker

A Parallel between Chinese and Hacker Culture.

In Chinese traditional culture, four tools are considered the most important for scholars: 

- brush
- ink
- paper
- ink stone

This set of tools is a well known concept named *The Four Treasures of the Study* (文房四寶) and has a Wikipedia page: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Treasures_of_the_Study> for it.

Much like Chinese scholars, the programmer's job comes down to information management.

So as a programmer and a person interested in China (two sets of people which I find to have a large intersection), I was compelled to create a programmer's version.

Behold, the **Four Treasures of the Hacker**:

- **file browser**: find and publish information
- **text editor**: produce information
- **web browser**: organize current state of the information into a tree
- **version control**: organize the history of the information into a tree and publish it

I also claim that there is a **5th** treasure missing from the original Four because it was taken for granted: **language**, which in hacker terms comes down to **compiers** and **interpreters**.

Whichever brands you pick (I've been following the path of Firefox + Vim + Krusader + Git + Python), these are the tools with which every programmer lives by every day.

They should be mastered and cherished by all of those who follow the path.
