# How I learned to code

The single most important thing is: strong desire to get some projects done to improve the world and get rich at the same time (education website and furthen full AI) + belief that maybe they were actually doable.

To do those projects, and so learned everything that I needed to do them. It so happened that the projects that I wanted to do  required learning software.

School was useless for me, I had some programming courses there, but they were useless like the rest, see also: http://www.cirosantilli.com/interests/ I want to destroy school BTW.

What enabled me to learn those things, were Stack Overflow, GitHub and the availability of open source software like Linux distros.

Next, but less important than motivation, are my natural inclinations to learning:

- obsession with minimal examples. Got one complex software that you want to use? Split it up into a bunch of minimal runnable examples to understand the subparts.
- give great important to standards (e.g. POSIX, etc.) and canonical sources (which implementation is this? where are the official docs? where is the source?)
- I can feel an intrinsic beauty of code as well to some extent

Those characteristics + my bad memory also make me a slower worker in average, but more solid and more likely to write better docs.
