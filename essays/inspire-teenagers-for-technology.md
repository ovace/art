# Inspire teenagers for technology

In late 2012, I went back to Brazil to finish my studies for a few months before coming back to Europe.

I visited back my home city, Santos, and felt the impulse to go to my old high school, called Objetivo, objective in Portuguese.

I hated my high school time. I was at one of the best, teachers treated be really well because I had good grades, and I had good friends and few conflicts.

But there was one fundamental problem: what I was doing was useless. The only goal was to pass the university exam. Memorizing a bunch of useless superficial stuff, much of which I don't care about.

Individually, each of those things are *very* interesting. Even now, I sometimes navigate Wikipedia like crazy learning high school stuff for real, and think: wow, that *is* cool.

It is that frustration that motivated me to study.

So I went back to school, talked to the teachers which remembered me and the principal, and the arranged to let me to give inspirational 10 minute talks to students.

I would go into several classes, and talk to them.

In that morning, I sat in the armchair of the school entrance, and decided what I would say.

The most important thing was: what is the most important subject?

People gave all types of answers.

Some of them said scientific subjects because they knew I liked that stuff.

Others, half joking, said the subject of the teacher who happened to be in the class at the time. So I jokingly covered the teacher's ears with my hands to eliminate bias.

Finally, someone would say my expected answer: "English".

I would ask them why?, and some would know the second expected answer: because once you know English, you can learn whatever you want.

Teachers agreed.

After the class, I stayed a bit to talk freely with the students.

I ended up making more contact with the "best ones" (more motivated, better grades, etc.).

They even came to my home twice for me to teach them to code.

But they eventually stopped. I could not interest them. They were more interested in getting gold in science competitions than learning university subjects for real.

From this days on, I ask myself: am I the only one who has that type of desire? Can I not inspire others?

And also I've decided that the only way to inspire others is online. Creating great content on Stack Overflow and GitHub.

Those who ever seek it, will find it. That is the most efficient action, which I undertake today.
