# Thoughts

Chuck Norris can parse pseudocode. (After my colleague was doing that in a project.)

If a product of a big company has a name that is too catchy, it is an acquisition. Otherwise, the name would be just "Big Company Product Description".

It's fun being at ARM. I look up some public information, then have an unanswered question, I can just look it up on the internal wiki.

Being in a stable relationship, but living separately and in the same time zone is the optimal way to work more (while at ARM Cambridge UK, fiancee in Paris)

Short thoughts which I had and amused me for a few seconds.

Having to fill those ugly .docx forms for enterprises makes me sick. Huge turnoff. Almost certain that they won't understand what you want you know, and what you want to do. Talking to someone is the only way for they to understand what you want to do.

Love watching my colleagues freely mixing French and Arab every 2 sentences when talking to their personal friends.

To succeed in creation: be half action, half planing. (2014-03, while developing GitLab, before success =))

We all need a spice of madness to take on the madness that is the world.

Without technology, one cannot survive. Without art, one cannot live.

Why do countries with the term "Democratic" or related on their official name, tend to be the least democratic? **People**'s Republic of China, "**Democratic** Republic of Congo".

Financial institutions make a lot of money. As a consequence, they adopt new technologies very quickly. The very contrary of educational institutions.

There is a close link between disruptive tech, and the desire to find bugs / exploits in systems. Both of them destabilize enterprises. Woz and Jobs started like that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box

Turing completeness is enough for mathematicians. Humans however need "runs Debian".
