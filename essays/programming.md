# Programming

I just love it when `cscope` caller list gives only one or two callers. No branching! Static analysis will work!

Before trying to modify something, understand all the external behaviour. Only then start going inside.

The joys of programming. Taking 2 hours to write a program that will run for 1s to accomplish a task you could do stupidly in 5 minutes.

The cool thing about programming the kernel is that there are no dependencies: GCC is all you need. There can be no other dependencies, since all else runs on top of it. Compare that to the insanity of low level instruments like GCC, Binutils and glibc which inter-depend circularly on build and run time.
