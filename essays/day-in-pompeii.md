# A day in Pompeii

Sept 11 2010, for an English assignment, based on my traveling experience.

Our trip was finally drawing to an end. Starting from the Venice, in the north of Italy, we had finally reached Rome, passing through Florence and many other smaller cities in the way. At this point, me and my mother were a bit tired of the museum-church-famous-square approach to tourism, and so we decided to take a day off and explore the famous city of Pompeii. And what a day it would be.

It was another one of those hot, cloudless Italian summer days. A few minutes after taking the regional train at Naples, and after having chatted with some of its highly communicative locals, we would meet the two defining natural features of our destination city. To our right, we could see the blue of the Tyrrhenian Sea, responsible for the flourishing of Pompeii as commercial city. To our right, the imposing Vesuvius, the cause of its ultimate and tragic decay.

After a pleasantly short entrance line (not always the case during Italian high-season), a few Euros lighter, and an audio guide heavier, we were finally ready to explore the city.

Immediately I would experience the most striking characteristic of the site: its incredible sense of modernity. I can say that this is not an exclusivity of Pompeii, but a common feature I felt on most contacts I had with Roman antiquities. But in this case the effect was amplified, maybe because of the sheer size of the city, or because it was virtually frozen in time by the 79AD eruption, only to be opened up by archaeological excavations of the mid 18th century.

Just like in our modern cities, streets are straight and orthogonal, in perfect contrast to the twisted streets of medieval Europe. The remains of administrative buildings surround the central square. As you stroll through the streets, you will also find what is left of ancient snack bars, food markets, bakeries, wall graffiti, water distribution facilities and a theater. At the local coliseum, the audio guide tells us of the interesting story of a violent conflict between Pompeian and their neighbor Nucerian inhabitants during games. The incident was so serious that the games were forbidden for the next ten years. A perfect analogy to hooligan behavior in modern stadiums. All of these similarities just make it evident how much our culture is a roman inheritance.

Of course, there are also some more exotic elements to be found in a 1st century city. Extremely shocking are the death casts of the people killed by the eruption. We can almost make out their facial expressions as they try in vain to protect their noses from the deadly ashes expelled by the volcano. Also very impressive is the floor mosaic in the once rich House of the Faun, an incredible reproduction of a Greek painting in the form of a mosaic made up of more than a million small stones. Latter on we came by a tourist crowded house. As we entered it, we discovered that the place was one of the local brothels, and contained well preserved frescoes of many sexual intercourse scenes. Finally, one cannot ignore the public baths, a Roman passion which involved a progressive transition from hot to cold waters.

Besides a superb source of historical interest, Pompeii is also a pleasant place to spend a relaxing afternoon between ruins of roman houses with a nice view to the Vesuvius. We would often sit down, just to enjoy the sun, and joke about how our legs had been artificially bronzed by Pompeii's characteristically thick and sticky volcanic dust.

All and all, the city is a very interesting and agreeable site, and should be undoubtedly placed high on the priority list of those explorers who are already in the Rome area.
