# Apple

Made up by two Steve's.

They've made a failed video game console: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Bandai_Pippin>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Terrell> and the Byte shop were the first sellers. Jobs managed to get the parts for the first 50 computer batch on credit with only with the COD promise from the retailer, so they gave away no equity.

Shareholder number 2 at the IPO <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Markkula> was an angel investor. He got rich with shares from Fairchild which he got through marketing and "retired" at 32. Then he was lured out of retirement only to invest in Apple... Lol wasn't he rich enough?

10 initial employees: <http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-early-employees-2011-5?op=1&IR=T>

Apple only transitioned to Intel chips in 2005, from it's older <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC> (Apply / IBM / Motorola alliance made). So *this* is where PowerPC on the Linux kernel tree comes from.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_screw> Even their screws are designed to prevent people from owning their products :-) Ah, looks like they are not alone: <http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1474:_Screws>

Amazing insider story of the Intel port: <https://www.quora.com/How-does-Apple-keep-secrets-so-well/answer/Kim-Scheinberg> Another one on that thread says that at the very early stages they had a sign on the entrance that said lose lips sink ships. They also mention products covered in black cloths when no one is working on them in case someone comes in by mistake.

Intel port 2005 announcement: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdTqnYnFyg> After he announces, he then reveals that the computer used for the slide presentation was an Intel CPU, and that OSX 10, then the last great update, was designed from the start for portability.

The prototype was done by one employee working on it full time for 18 months from 2000, and Jobs wanted Sony VAIO to ship it at first! <http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5380832/sony-vaio-apple-os-x-steve-jobs-meeting-report>

They design their own ARM CPU's: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A7> TODO since when?

OS X from 1999 was the first UNIX based OS they sold, which came from the NeXT buy.

XEROX, after inventing the GUI, Ethernet and OOP, kind of gave the GUI away to Apple. Apple took and commercialized it. As Jobs put it, the Apple 2 was running out of gas. Macintosh was the first GUI computer from Apple. It was named after the McIntosh apple cultivar: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntosh_%28apple%29>

Windows managed to gain market because:

- they had tons of applications from IBM compatibility
- they sold cheaper, partly because Intel owned Motorola which made the CPU of Apple (PowerPC predecessor)

They managed to take a bit back by selling to artists, who love a GUI.

Macworld Boston 1997-The Microsoft Deal <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxOp5mBY9IY> Bill Gate's Giant head on stage. Apple was out of cash, Jobs had just come back. And the Microsoft money saved them. That was before Apple's iPod and iPhone megahits, and when Microsoft was facing patent charges for stealing Apple's GUI.

Woz was an HP employee, and he offered Apple I to HP 5 times. He was obliged by hist contract. <http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/06/apple_co_founder_offered_first_computer_design_to_hp_5_times>

Apple licensed Basic from Microsoft.

The street of their headquarters is called <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Loop_%28street%29>

iPod history: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQwzI4kBG1o>

One of the major decisions when Jobs came back to Apple was reduce the number of products from 50 to 10. Focus is all.

## iPod

<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1224523/>

Napster was the spark for iPod: Jobs noticed the huge interest in music that it generated.

iTunes was built upon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundJam_MP , which was made by former Apple employees who made a new company.

The first ones were hard disk based!

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deopyTQOn7I> amazing keynote.

It was firewire based: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1394> So it was binded to the iMac.

They had found a huge hole in the market. Do watch the keynote: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deopyTQOn7I>

The white earphones was not in the initial marketing effort, but it then became a brand stable.

Another defining thing is selling individual songs instead of albums and subscriptions, and it was really hard to fix a single price per record, which is a really consistent interface.

3rd generation introduced Windows compatibility.

After the initial success, they then made several variations, to satisfy all consumers.

## iPhone

There's an app for that 2009 commercial: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg>

Apple filed a trademark application for it: <http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/apple-trademark/#K3_v8pF8niqG>

## MacBook pro in university

> Indeed, for a number of years, it wasn't a huge exaggeration to say that Apple made the only x86 laptops that were both reasonably affordable and pleasant to use. The MacBook Air, in particular, set a new standard for size and weight, and while the initial release was expensive, subsequent iterations were much less so. The traditional PC world had little that could match, and even when PC OEMs did build good systems—as Lenovo often did—they tended to be high-priced "corporate" machines. Apple truly led the way when it came to offering that mix of price, power, and portability, and it did so with an operating system that just happened to use a large portion of FreeBSD's code. There are still, of course, differences between OS X's FreeBSD and Linux running on a server, but they're a great deal smaller than the differences between either of those and Windows.

> What Apple did was to give every computer science and software engineering student a three-pound Unix workstation for not very much money, and unsurprisingly, they proliferated. This effect was compounded further by Apple's enduring popularity in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Smart kids fresh out of university (whether they dropped out or otherwise) weren't thrust into the Windows-centric world of corporate America. They could instead thrive in a culture that revered Apple and equipped them all with shiny new MacBook Pros. Windows wasn't reviled the way that the die-hard open source advocates reviled it; it just wasn't part of their life.

This culture still exists!

## Campus 2

There isn't a straight piece of glass on the whole building.
