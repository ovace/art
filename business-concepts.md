Business concepts and vocabulary that made my brain tickle when I understood them.

-   hedge fund vs VC.

    hedge fund: everyone puts some money, and a manager decides entirely where to invest.

    VC: the investor himself (the VC) decides where to invest the money.


-   Aqui-hire: the larger guy buys you, but keeps you employed to keep running operations.

-   Business model.

    How you make money: what you charge or not for, how much.

    Examples:

    - payed
    - freemium: pay for some features only.
    - organization: donations
    - closed / open / semi open source

-   Roadmap.

    Longer term strategy: where you are moving towards.

-   Growth vs Profit? Offer free products so that you become more popular (growth) or charge people a lot and make short term profit?

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Business> vs funding: a process that is in a state that needs no external input.

    For an enterprise: they leave out of actual revenue, not investments.
