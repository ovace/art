# English

As an "advanced" non native speaker, I always learn a few new terms every month.

Here are some cool ones:

-   <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=glory%20hole>

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_%28literature%29>

    Saw as rhetorical device.

-   everything but the kitchen sink: everything, including lots of superfluous stuff.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_song>

-   expediency

    The quality of being convenient and practical despite possibly being improper or immoral; convenience.

-   Water cooler: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cooler>

    Has led to the expression "water-cooler talk", which means office gossip.

    May also used with a non negative connotation for less serious work related information, e.g. GitHub has a `watercooler` category on it's blog: <https://github.com/blog/category/watercooler>

-   <http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/verboten>

    Verboten: strictly forbidden. Comes from German. I feel that the foreign language feel to it has an emphasis effect.

-   <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=everyone%20and%20their%20mother>

    Seen it twice today on unrelated sources and thought: it's a fixed expression...

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_pen_letter>

-   Rage quit: stop doing something in rage, often because you were beaten.

-   Conspicuous: very visible, stands out.

-   Mud in your eye: like cheers when toasting, disputed origin. Possible origin: Jesus on the bible cures the blind with mud, so it can be a way to say "good health to us".

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw_out_the_baby_with_the_bath_water>

    Comes from German.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_food>

-   [to hit paydirt](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hit+pay+dirt)

-   [IOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU)

-   [Guerrilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare) comes from Spanish, used in English since 1908. TODO: which particular movements / articles popularized the word?

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product>
