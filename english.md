As an "advanced" non native speaker, I always learn a few new terms every week.

Here are some that tickled my brain and made me smile:

- [IOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU)

- [Guerrilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare) comes from Spanish, used in English since 1908. TODO: which particular movements / articles popularized the word?

- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product>
