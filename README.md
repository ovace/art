# Art

Fun only, subjective and non professional texts by me or others.

Mostly links to stuff like, sometimes with small comments explaining why. Except for the [essays/](essays/) directory, which contains stuff that I mostly wrote.

If you think something belongs on a list, PR. Because of the subjective nature of this repo, I may chose to decline PRs without much logical reason, but I will take it into consideration with all my heart =).
