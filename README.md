This repo contains art (whatever that is) by me or others, art best of lists, and related stuff.

It is fun only, subjective and non professional.

If you think something belongs on a list, PR. Because of the subjective nature of this repo, I may chose to decline PRs without much logical reason, but I will take it into consideration with all my heart =).
