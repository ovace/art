Fun only, subjective and non professional texts by me or others.

If you think something belongs on a list, PR. Because of the subjective nature of this repo, I may chose to decline PRs without much logical reason, but I will take it into consideration with all my heart =).

Files which may be interesting to other people:

- [misc.md](misc.md): main dump of interesting things.
- [war.md](computer.md)
- [computer.md](computer.md)

Things which I want to say to K12 people:

- [essays/how-to-learn.md](essays/how-to-learn.md)
