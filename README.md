# film quotes

Once upon a time in the west 1968:

- looks like we're short one horse
- 42: inside them there were three men, inside them there were 3 bullets.
- 1:06: its almost like holding a gun. Only much more powerful.
- 1:50: there were no dollars on 'em' days
- 2:14: so you found out you weren't a business man after all.
